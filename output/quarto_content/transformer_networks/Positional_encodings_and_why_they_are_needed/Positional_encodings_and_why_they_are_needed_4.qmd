## Question: 5. What are relative positional encodings, and how do they differ from absolute positional encodings in practice?

**Best Answer**

Positional encodings are crucial in sequence modeling, particularly in architectures like Transformers, because the inherent structure of self-attention mechanisms is permutation-invariant. This means the order of the input tokens doesn't affect the computation unless we explicitly provide positional information. Positional encodings inject information about the position of tokens in the sequence, allowing the model to understand the relationships between elements based on their order.

### Absolute Positional Encodings

Absolute positional encodings directly encode the position of each token within the sequence. A common approach involves using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, as originally proposed in the "Attention is All You Need" paper. The positional encoding $PE$ for position $pos$ and dimension $i$ is defined as:

$$
PE(pos, 2i) = sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
$$

$$
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
$$

where:
- $pos$ is the position of the token in the sequence.
- $i$ is the dimension index.
- $d_{model}$ is the dimensionality of the positional encoding (and the model's embedding space).

Alternatively, learnable positional embeddings can be used, where each position is assigned a unique vector that is learned during training.

*Advantages:*
- Simple to implement.
- Effective for sequences of lengths seen during training.

*Disadvantages:*
- Performance degrades when extrapolating to longer sequences than those seen during training. The model has no inherent way of understanding positions beyond the maximum length it was trained on.
- Less flexible in capturing relationships between tokens based on their relative distance.

### Relative Positional Encodings

Relative positional encodings, on the other hand, encode the *relative distance* between tokens. Instead of embedding the absolute position, they embed the offset or displacement between pairs of tokens.  This approach is particularly useful when the precise absolute position is less important than the relationship between tokens.

One common approach is to modify the attention mechanism. In the standard self-attention mechanism, the attention weights are calculated as:

$$
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where:
- $Q$ is the query matrix.
- $K$ is the key matrix.
- $V$ is the value matrix.
- $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the key vectors.

With relative positional encodings, the attention calculation is modified to include positional information:

$$
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\left(\frac{QK^T + S}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Here, $S$ is a matrix of relative position embeddings.  Each element $S_{ij}$ represents the embedding for the relative distance between the $i$-th and $j$-th tokens in the sequence. This embedding can be learned or pre-defined.
Another approach involves directly incorporating relative position embeddings into the key and value vectors.

*Advantages:*

- **Better generalization to longer sequences:** Relative encodings generalize better because they focus on relative distances, which can be more consistent across different sequence lengths. The model learns relationships based on proximity rather than absolute location.
- **Robustness to position shift:** The model becomes more robust to shifts in the sequence because the relative distances remain the same even if the entire sequence is shifted.
- **Improved handling of variable-length sequences:** Relative encodings naturally accommodate variable-length sequences because they focus on pairwise relationships between tokens.

*Disadvantages:*

- **Increased complexity:** Implementing relative positional encodings can be more complex than absolute encodings, requiring modifications to the attention mechanism.
- **Higher memory usage:** Depending on the implementation, relative encodings can require more memory, especially for long sequences, due to the need to store pairwise relationships. Although sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this.

### Practical Differences and Considerations

In practice, the choice between absolute and relative positional encodings depends on the specific task and dataset.

- **Task Type:** For tasks where absolute position is critical (e.g., certain types of time series forecasting or tasks requiring precise alignment), absolute encodings might be more suitable. For tasks where the relationship between tokens is more important than their absolute position (e.g., machine translation, text summarization), relative encodings tend to perform better.

- **Sequence Length:** For shorter sequences, the difference between the two approaches may be minimal. However, as sequence length increases, relative encodings often outperform absolute encodings due to their better generalization properties.

- **Computational Cost:** Relative encodings can introduce additional computational overhead, especially if not implemented efficiently. The choice should consider the trade-off between performance gains and computational cost.  Techniques like sparse attention can help to mitigate these costs.

- **Implementation Complexity:** Absolute encodings are generally easier to implement, whereas relative encodings often require modifying the attention mechanism or other parts of the model architecture.

In summary, while absolute positional encodings provide a straightforward way to inject positional information, relative positional encodings offer a more flexible and robust approach, especially for longer sequences and tasks where the relationships between tokens are paramount. The key is to understand the trade-offs and choose the encoding scheme that best aligns with the specific requirements of the task at hand.
