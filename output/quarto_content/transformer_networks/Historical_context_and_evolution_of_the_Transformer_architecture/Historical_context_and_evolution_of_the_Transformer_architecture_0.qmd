## Question: 1. Explain the key innovations introduced in the original 'Attention Is All You Need' paper. How did these innovations depart from previous sequence models that relied on RNNs or CNNs?

**Best Answer**

The "Attention Is All You Need" paper (Vaswani et al., 2017) revolutionized sequence modeling by introducing the Transformer architecture. It departed significantly from previous sequence models that were predominantly based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The core innovations and their impact are detailed below:

**1. Self-Attention Mechanism:**

*   **Innovation:** The Transformer replaced recurrence with self-attention. Self-attention allows the model to relate different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the same sequence. This is in stark contrast to RNNs, which process sequences sequentially, and CNNs, which have a limited receptive field.

*   **Mathematical Formulation:** The self-attention mechanism computes attention weights based on three learned matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).
    $$
    \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
    $$
    where $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors.  The division by $\sqrt{d_k}$ is a scaling factor to prevent the softmax from becoming too peaked, which can hinder learning.

*   **Impact:** Self-attention enables parallel computation, unlike RNNs, and captures long-range dependencies more effectively than both RNNs and CNNs.  Each position in the sequence can directly attend to any other position, regardless of distance.

**2. Multi-Head Attention:**

*   **Innovation:** Instead of using a single attention mechanism, the Transformer employs multiple "heads" that perform self-attention independently and in parallel.

*   **Mathematical Formulation:**
    1.  Project the queries, keys, and values $h$ times with different, learned linear projections to $d_k$, $d_k$ and $d_v$ dimensions, respectively.
        $$
        Q_i = QW_i^Q, K_i = KW_i^K, V_i = VW_i^V
        $$

    2.  Apply attention to each of projected version of queries, keys, and values in parallel
        $$
        \text{Attention}(Q_i, K_i, V_i) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_iK_i^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_i
        $$
    3.  Concatenate and project
        $$
        \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O \\
        \text{where head}_i = \text{Attention}(Q_i, K_i, V_i)
        $$
        where $W_i^Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_k}$, $W_i^K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_k}$, $W_i^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_v}$ and $W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{hd_v \times d_{model}}$

*   **Impact:** This allows the model to capture different aspects of relationships within the data. Each attention head can learn a different representation of the input sequence, providing a richer understanding of the relationships between words or tokens. Multi-head attention significantly boosts the model's ability to capture diverse dependencies.

**3. Positional Encoding:**

*   **Innovation:** Since self-attention is permutation-invariant (i.e., it doesn't inherently capture the order of the sequence), the Transformer uses positional encodings to incorporate information about the position of tokens in the sequence.

*   **Mathematical Formulation:**  The paper uses sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
    $$
    PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right) \\
    PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{model}}}\right)
    $$
    where $pos$ is the position and $i$ is the dimension.  This encoding is added to the input embeddings.  Other positional encoding schemes (learned or fixed) can also be used.

*   **Impact:** This allows the model to understand the order of the words or tokens, which is crucial for sequence modeling tasks. Positional encodings provide a way to inject information about the absolute or relative position of the tokens in the sequence.

**4. Encoder-Decoder Structure:**

*   **Innovation:** The Transformer follows the encoder-decoder structure, similar to many sequence-to-sequence models. The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence.

*   **Impact:** This structure is effective for tasks like machine translation, where the input and output sequences may have different lengths and structures. The encoder creates a representation of the input sequence, and the decoder uses this representation to generate the output sequence, attending to relevant parts of the encoded input using attention mechanisms.

**5. Feed-Forward Networks:**

*   **Innovation:**  Each encoder and decoder layer contains a feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This network typically consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

*   **Mathematical Formulation:**
    $$
    \text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
    $$
    where $W_1$, $W_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are learned parameters.

*   **Impact:**  This provides additional non-linearity and feature transformation capabilities at each layer. The feed-forward networks introduce complexity and allow the model to learn more intricate patterns in the data.

**6. Residual Connections and Layer Normalization:**

*   **Innovation:**  The Transformer uses residual connections around each sub-layer (self-attention, feed-forward networks), followed by layer normalization.

*   **Mathematical Formulation:**
    $$
    \text{LayerNorm}(x) = \gamma \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} + \beta
    $$
    where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of the layer's inputs, and $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable scale and shift parameters.

*   **Impact:**  Residual connections help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for the training of deeper networks. Layer normalization stabilizes the training process and improves convergence.

**Departures from RNNs and CNNs:**

*   **RNNs:** RNNs process sequences sequentially, making parallelization difficult. They also struggle with long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.  The Transformer addresses these issues with self-attention and parallel computation.

*   **CNNs:** CNNs, while parallelizable, have a limited receptive field. To capture long-range dependencies, multiple convolutional layers or dilated convolutions are required, which can be computationally expensive. Self-attention allows the Transformer to capture long-range dependencies directly.

In summary, the Transformer's key innovations—self-attention, multi-head attention, positional encodings, and a fully attention-based architecture—have enabled it to outperform RNNs and CNNs on a variety of sequence modeling tasks, while also offering significant advantages in terms of parallelization and capturing long-range dependencies.
