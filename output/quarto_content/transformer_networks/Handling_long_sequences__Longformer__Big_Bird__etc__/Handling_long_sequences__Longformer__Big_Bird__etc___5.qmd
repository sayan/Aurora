## Question: 6. Could you mathematically detail how the computational complexity changes when using sparse attention compared to full attention in transformers?

**Best Answer**

The computational complexity of attention mechanisms is a crucial factor when dealing with long sequences in transformers. Standard (full) attention has quadratic complexity, which becomes a bottleneck for very long inputs. Sparse attention mechanisms offer a way to reduce this complexity, enabling transformers to process longer sequences. Let's break down the mathematics of both full and sparse attention.

**1. Full Attention**

In standard self-attention, for each token in the input sequence, we compute attention weights with respect to every other token. Given an input sequence of length $n$, the computational complexity stems from the attention weight calculation and the weighted sum operation.

*   **Attention Weight Calculation:** For each of the $n$ tokens, we compute the attention weights by taking the dot product of its query vector ($q_i$) with all $n$ key vectors ($k_j$) and then applying a softmax function. This results in an $n \times n$ attention matrix.
    The dot product computation requires $n$ dot products each of dimension $d_k$ (key dimension), leading to $O(n^2 d_k)$ complexity.
    The softmax operation on each row of the $n \times n$ matrix takes $O(n)$ operations per row or $O(n^2)$ overall.

*   **Weighted Sum:**  After calculating attention weights, we compute a weighted sum of the value vectors ($v_j$). This operation involves multiplying the $n \times n$ attention matrix by the $n \times d_v$ value matrix, where $d_v$ is the value dimension. This matrix multiplication has a complexity of $O(n^2 d_v)$.

Combining both steps, the overall complexity of full attention is:

$$O(n^2 d_k) + O(n^2) + O(n^2 d_v) \approx O(n^2 d)$$

where $d$ is the dimension of the keys/values, assuming $d_k \approx d_v \approx d$. Therefore, the full attention mechanism scales quadratically with the sequence length $n$.

**2. Sparse Attention**

Sparse attention aims to reduce the computational cost by attending only to a subset of tokens for each token in the input sequence. Several sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed, each with different patterns and complexity. We will examine a few common examples:

*   **Fixed Pattern Sparse Attention (e.g., Longformer):**  Each token attends to $w$ neighboring tokens and a small number of global tokens. This leads to a complexity that scales linearly.  Let's assume each token attends to a fixed number $w$ of local neighboring tokens plus $g$ global tokens.

    *   For each of the $n$ tokens, we compute attention weights with respect to $w + g$ tokens.
    *   The dot product operation thus has complexity $O(n (w+g) d_k)$.
    *   Similarly, the weighted sum operation has complexity $O(n (w+g) d_v)$.

    The overall complexity becomes:

    $$O(n (w+g) d_k) + O(n (w+g)) + O(n (w+g) d_v) \approx O(n w d) + O(n g d)$$

    Since $w$ and $g$ are constants independent of $n$, this simplifies to $O(n d)$, which is linear in sequence length.

*   **Strided Attention:**  Every $s$-th token attends to all tokens.  The other tokens attend to their neighbors.  This can be viewed as a compromise, balancing computational cost with the ability to capture longer-range dependencies.

    *   A fraction $1/s$ of tokens attend to all $n$ tokens, giving $O(\frac{n}{s} n d)$
    *   The other $n - \frac{n}{s}$ tokens attend to their local neighbors, giving $O((n-\frac{n}{s}) w d) \approx O(n w d)$
    *   Total complexity: $O(\frac{n^2}{s} d) + O(n w d)$

    If $w$ is a constant, the complexity is dominated by the $O(\frac{n^2}{s} d)$ term.  This can be linear if $s \propto n$ i.e. only a *fixed number* of tokens attend to all other tokens, irrespective of sequence length.

*   **Block Sparse Attention (e.g., BigBird):**  The input sequence is divided into blocks. Each token attends to tokens within its block and a few other randomly selected blocks, as well as some global tokens. Assume block size $b$, number of random blocks $r$, and number of global tokens $g$.

    *   Each token attends to tokens within its block ($b$), tokens in $r$ random blocks ($r b$), and the global tokens ($g$).
    *   Total attention count per token = $b + rb + g$.
    *   Complexity: $O(n (b + rb + g) d)$.  If $b, r, g$ are constants, then the complexity is $O(n d)$.

*   **Learnable Sparse Attention:** The attention pattern is learned during training. This can lead to more efficient patterns optimized for the specific task, but introduces the complexity of learning the pattern itself.  The computational complexity depends on the learned pattern, but the goal is to achieve sub-quadratic complexity.

**Summary Table:**

| Attention Type          | Computational Complexity        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Full Attention          | $O(n^2 d)$                     |
| Fixed Sparse (Longformer) | $O(n d)$                     |
| Strided Attention       | $O(\frac{n^2}{s} d) + O(n w d)$     |
| Block Sparse (BigBird)    | $O(n d)$                     |

**Importance and Real-World Considerations**

The reduction in computational complexity afforded by sparse attention is crucial for handling long sequences, enabling applications in areas such as:

*   **Long Document Summarization:** Processing entire documents without truncation.
*   **Genomics:** Analyzing long DNA sequences.
*   **Audio Processing:**  Modeling long audio streams.

Implementation details matter.  Sparse attention often requires custom CUDA kernels for efficient computation, particularly on GPUs. Naive implementations can negate the theoretical benefits. The choice of sparse pattern depends on the task. Fixed patterns might be suitable for local dependencies, while more complex patterns are needed for long-range dependencies.

**How to Narrate**

1.  **Start with the Problem:**  "The key challenge with transformers on long sequences is the quadratic complexity of full attention, which makes it computationally expensive. This prevents us from processing very long documents or other extended inputs."

2.  **Introduce Full Attention Complexity:** "In full attention, for each token, we compute attention weights with all other tokens. Mathematically, this involves computing dot products between each query and all keys, resulting in an $n \times n$ attention matrix, where $n$ is the sequence length. The complexity of this operation, and the subsequent weighted sum, is $O(n^2 d)$, where $d$ is the feature dimension." (Write the equation on a whiteboard if available).

3.  **Introduce Sparse Attention:** "Sparse attention tackles this by attending to only a subset of tokens. Several strategies exist to reduce computational complexity."

4.  **Explain a Few Sparse Attention Strategies (e.g., Longformer, BigBird):**  "For example, Longformer uses a combination of sliding window attention and global attention. Each token attends to its neighbors within a window and to a few global tokens. This reduces the complexity to $O(n w d)$, where $w$ is the window size, making it linear in sequence length."

5.  **Summarize Complexities (Optional):** "So, moving from $O(n^2 d)$ in full attention to $O(n d)$ in sparse attention allows us to handle much longer sequences. BigBird also achieves linear complexity using block sparse attention where each token only attends to tokens within its block, a few random blocks, and global tokens."
