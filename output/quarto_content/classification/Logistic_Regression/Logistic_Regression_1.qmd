## Question: 2. Derive the likelihood function for logistic regression. Why do we often use the log-likelihood instead of the raw likelihood in optimization?

**Best Answer**

Logistic Regression is a statistical model used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.  The core idea is to model the relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable that takes on one of two values (0 or 1). The model uses the logistic function (sigmoid function) to map predicted values to probabilities.

**1. Derivation of the Likelihood Function**

Let's denote:

*   $x_i$ as the feature vector for the $i$-th observation.
*   $y_i$ as the binary outcome for the $i$-th observation ($y_i \in \{0, 1\}$).
*   $\theta$ as the vector of model parameters (coefficients).
*   $h_\theta(x_i)$ as the predicted probability that $y_i = 1$ given $x_i$ and $\theta$.  Mathematically, this is represented by the sigmoid function:

$$h_\theta(x_i) = P(y_i = 1 | x_i; \theta) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x_i}}$$

Since $y_i$ can only be 0 or 1, the probability of $y_i = 0$ is simply:

$$P(y_i = 0 | x_i; \theta) = 1 - h_\theta(x_i) = \frac{e^{-\theta^T x_i}}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x_i}}$$

We can express both probabilities concisely as:

$$P(y_i | x_i; \theta) = h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i} (1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)}$$

*Explanation:*  If $y_i = 1$, the term $(1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)}$ becomes $(1 - h_\theta(x_i))^0 = 1$, and we are left with $h_\theta(x_i)$, which is $P(y_i = 1)$. If $y_i = 0$, the term $h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i}$ becomes $h_\theta(x_i)^0 = 1$, and we are left with $(1 - h_\theta(x_i))$, which is $P(y_i = 0)$.

Now, assuming that the observations are independent, the likelihood function $L(\theta)$ is the product of the probabilities for all observations:

$$L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(y_i | x_i; \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i} (1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)}$$

This likelihood function represents the probability of observing the given set of outcomes ($y_i$ values) given the input features ($x_i$ values) and the model parameters ($\theta$).  The goal of logistic regression is to find the values of $\theta$ that maximize this likelihood function.

**2. Why Use Log-Likelihood?**

Instead of directly maximizing the likelihood function $L(\theta)$, we often maximize the log-likelihood function, denoted as $\ell(\theta)$ or $LL(\theta)$.  The log-likelihood is simply the natural logarithm of the likelihood function:

$$\ell(\theta) = \ln(L(\theta)) = \ln \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i} (1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)} \right)$$

Using properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as a sum:

$$\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln \left( h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i} (1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ y_i \ln(h_\theta(x_i)) + (1-y_i) \ln(1 - h_\theta(x_i)) \right]$$

Here are the main reasons for using the log-likelihood:

*   **Numerical Stability:** Probabilities $h_\theta(x_i)$ are typically small values between 0 and 1.  When multiplying many small probabilities together, as in the likelihood function, the result can become extremely small, potentially leading to underflow errors (loss of precision) in computer calculations. Taking the logarithm transforms these small probabilities into negative numbers, and summing them is much more numerically stable than multiplying many small numbers.

*   **Simplification of Derivatives:**  The logarithm transforms a product into a sum.  This simplifies the process of differentiation, which is crucial for optimization algorithms like gradient descent.  It's generally easier to compute the derivative of a sum than the derivative of a product.  Specifically, the derivative of the log-likelihood function has a simpler form, which makes the optimization process more efficient.

*   **Monotonic Transformation:** The logarithm is a monotonically increasing function.  This means that if $L(\theta_1) > L(\theta_2)$, then $\ln(L(\theta_1)) > \ln(L(\theta_2))$.  Therefore, maximizing the log-likelihood function is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function itself.  We can find the same optimal parameters $\theta$ by maximizing either function.

*   **Connection to Cross-Entropy Loss:** The negative log-likelihood function is directly related to the cross-entropy loss, which is commonly used as the loss function in logistic regression.  Minimizing the cross-entropy loss is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood.

In summary, using the log-likelihood function in logistic regression provides numerical stability, simplifies differentiation for optimization, and is equivalent to using the likelihood function due to the monotonic property of the logarithm.

**How to Narrate**

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to explain this during an interview:

1.  **Start with the Basics:** "Logistic regression is used for binary classification, predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class."

2.  **Introduce the Sigmoid Function:** "The core of logistic regression is the sigmoid (or logistic) function, which maps the linear combination of features to a probability between 0 and 1.  The equation is: $h_\theta(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^T x}}$ ." *Explain briefly that $\theta$ represents the parameters we want to learn, and $x$ is the feature vector.*

3.  **Derive the Likelihood (Walk through the derivation, but keep it high-level):**

    *   "For a single observation, the probability of seeing the actual outcome $y_i$ can be expressed as $P(y_i | x_i; \theta) = h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i} (1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)}$. If $y_i$ is 1, it simplifies to $h_\theta(x_i)$ and if $y_i$ is 0, it simplifies to $1 - h_\theta(x_i)$ ." *Pause briefly to ensure the interviewer is following.*
    *   "Assuming independence between observations, the likelihood function becomes the product of these probabilities over all data points: $L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} h_\theta(x_i)^{y_i} (1 - h_\theta(x_i))^{(1-y_i)}$ ." *Emphasize that this is the function we want to maximize.*

4.  **Explain the Transition to Log-Likelihood:** "Instead of maximizing the likelihood directly, we usually maximize the log-likelihood, which is simply the natural logarithm of the likelihood function: $\ell(\theta) = \ln(L(\theta))$ ."

5.  **Justify Log-Likelihood (Explain the advantages):**

    *   **Numerical Stability:** "Firstly, it provides numerical stability. Multiplying many small probabilities can lead to underflow. The log transforms these probabilities to negative values which sums up instead of multiplying, preventing underflow issues."
    *   **Simplification:** "Secondly, it simplifies the optimization process. The logarithm turns the product into a sum: $\ell(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ y_i \ln(h_\theta(x_i)) + (1-y_i) \ln(1 - h_\theta(x_i)) \right]$. This makes taking derivatives for gradient-based optimization much easier." *You can briefly mention that the derivative of a sum is easier to compute than the derivative of a product.*
    *   **Monotonicity:** "And finally, since the logarithm is a monotonic function, maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood.  We get the same optimal parameters."
    *   **Cross Entropy**: You can also state that negative log likelihood is the cross entropy loss which is what we are minimizing when training a logistic regression model.

6.  **Summarize:** "So, in summary, we use the log-likelihood in logistic regression for numerical stability, to simplify the differentiation process during optimization, and because it's equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function itself."

**Communication Tips:**

*   **Pace Yourself:** Don't rush through the explanation, especially when discussing the derivation and formulas.
*   **Use Visual Cues:** If you are in a virtual interview, consider sharing your screen and using a document (like a whiteboard or a prepared document) to write out the formulas.
*   **Check for Understanding:** After explaining a key step, pause and ask, "Does that make sense?" or "Are you following me so far?". This ensures the interviewer is engaged and understands the concepts.
*   **Relate to Practical Implications:** Emphasize the practical benefits of using the log-likelihood, such as improved numerical stability and easier optimization. This shows you understand the "why" behind the theory.
*   **Avoid Overwhelming with Math:** If the interviewer seems less mathematically inclined, focus more on the intuitive explanations and less on the detailed derivations. You can offer to provide more details if they are interested. Tailor your explanation to their background.
