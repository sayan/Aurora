## Question: 3. Derive the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) used in training VAEs. Discuss its components and explain why maximizing the ELBO is equivalent to approximating the true log-likelihood of the data.

**Best Answer**

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that leverage variational inference to approximate the intractable posterior distribution of latent variables given observed data. The core objective in training a VAE is to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. However, directly maximizing this likelihood is computationally infeasible due to the intractability of the integral over the latent space. The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) provides a tractable lower bound to this log-likelihood, allowing for efficient training.

**1. Derivation of the ELBO:**

Let's denote:
- $x$: Observed data
- $z$: Latent variable
- $p_\theta(x)$: Likelihood of the data $x$ parameterized by $\theta$
- $p_\theta(z)$: Prior distribution of the latent variable $z$ parameterized by $\theta$.  Usually, we assume this to be a standard normal distribution, i.e., $p(z) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
- $p_\theta(x|z)$: Likelihood of the data $x$ given the latent variable $z$ parameterized by $\theta$ (decoder).  Usually modeled by a neural network.
- $q_\phi(z|x)$: Approximate posterior distribution of the latent variable $z$ given the data $x$ parameterized by $\phi$ (encoder).  Also usually modeled by a neural network and called the variational distribution.

The objective is to maximize the marginal log-likelihood of the data:

$$
\log p_\theta(x) = \log \int p_\theta(x, z) dz
$$

Since the integral is intractable, we introduce the variational distribution $q_\phi(z|x)$ and use it to derive a lower bound on the log-likelihood. We start by multiplying and dividing by $q_\phi(z|x)$ inside the logarithm:

$$
\log p_\theta(x) = \log \int p_\theta(x, z) \frac{q_\phi(z|x)}{q_\phi(z|x)} dz
$$

Now, we use Jensen's inequality. Since the logarithm is a concave function, we have:

$$
\log \mathbb{E}[X] \geq \mathbb{E}[\log X]
$$

Applying Jensen's inequality to the integral:

$$
\log p_\theta(x) = \log \int q_\phi(z|x) \frac{p_\theta(x, z)}{q_\phi(z|x)} dz \geq \int q_\phi(z|x) \log \frac{p_\theta(x, z)}{q_\phi(z|x)} dz
$$

This gives us the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):

$$
\text{ELBO} = \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \int q_\phi(z|x) \log \frac{p_\theta(x, z)}{q_\phi(z|x)} dz
$$

We can rewrite the ELBO as:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \int q_\phi(z|x) \log p_\theta(x, z) dz - \int q_\phi(z|x) \log q_\phi(z|x) dz
$$

Further, we can decompose $p_\theta(x, z)$ using the product rule: $p_\theta(x, z) = p_\theta(x|z) p_\theta(z)$. Thus,

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \int q_\phi(z|x) \log [p_\theta(x|z) p_\theta(z)] dz - \int q_\phi(z|x) \log q_\phi(z|x) dz
$$

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \int q_\phi(z|x) \log p_\theta(x|z) dz + \int q_\phi(z|x) \log p_\theta(z) dz - \int q_\phi(z|x) \log q_\phi(z|x) dz
$$

The ELBO can then be expressed as:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q_\phi(z|x)} [\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z))
$$

**2. Components of the ELBO:**

The ELBO consists of two main components:

1.  **Reconstruction Term (Expected Log-Likelihood):** $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim q_\phi(z|x)} [\log p_\theta(x|z)]$

    *   This term encourages the model to accurately reconstruct the input data $x$ from the latent representation $z$. It measures how well the decoder $p_\theta(x|z)$ can reconstruct the input $x$ given a latent code $z$ sampled from the approximate posterior $q_\phi(z|x)$.  This is often implemented as a negative log-likelihood between the input and the reconstructed output.  For example, if $x$ is binary, we might use a Bernoulli likelihood, or if $x$ is real-valued, we might use a Gaussian likelihood.

2.  **KL Divergence Term:** $\text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z))$

    *   This term acts as a regularizer, encouraging the approximate posterior $q_\phi(z|x)$ to be close to the prior distribution $p_\theta(z)$.  It measures the dissimilarity between the learned approximate posterior distribution $q_\phi(z|x)$ and the prior distribution $p_\theta(z)$ over the latent space.  A common choice for the prior is a standard Gaussian, $p(z) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.  In this case, the KL divergence has a closed-form solution if $q_\phi(z|x)$ is also Gaussian. Specifically, if $q_\phi(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then:
        $$
        \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z)) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^d (\mu_i^2 + \sigma_i^2 - \log \sigma_i^2 - 1)
        $$
        where $d$ is the dimensionality of the latent space.

**3. Maximizing the ELBO and Approximating the True Log-Likelihood:**

Maximizing the ELBO is equivalent to approximating the true log-likelihood because:

$$
\log p_\theta(x) = \mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) + \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z|x))
$$

Rearranging the terms, we get:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \log p_\theta(x) - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z|x))
$$

Since the KL divergence is always non-negative, $\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) \leq \log p_\theta(x)$.  Therefore, the ELBO is indeed a lower bound on the marginal log-likelihood.

Maximizing $\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x)$ with respect to $\theta$ and $\phi$ simultaneously achieves two goals:

1.  It increases the lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data, thus improving the generative capability of the model.
2.  It forces the approximate posterior $q_\phi(z|x)$ to be close to the true (but intractable) posterior $p_\theta(z|x)$.

By maximizing the ELBO, we are indirectly maximizing a lower bound on the data likelihood, making the latent variable model a good approximation of the true data distribution.  Furthermore, the VAE learns a useful latent space representation that can be used for downstream tasks such as data generation, data compression, and representation learning.

**Real-World Considerations:**

*   **Reparameterization Trick:** To compute gradients with respect to the parameters $\phi$ of the variational distribution $q_\phi(z|x)$, we use the reparameterization trick.  This involves expressing the latent variable $z$ as a deterministic function of $\phi$ and a noise variable $\epsilon$ drawn from a fixed distribution (e.g., a standard normal).  For example, if $q_\phi(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we can write $z = \mu + \sigma \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.  This allows us to backpropagate through the sampling process.
*   **Mini-Batch Training:** VAEs are typically trained using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.  The ELBO is computed for each mini-batch, and the gradients are used to update the parameters $\theta$ and $\phi$.
*   **Choice of Architectures:** The encoder and decoder are typically implemented as neural networks. The choice of architecture depends on the nature of the data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often used for image data, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used for sequential data.
*   **Balancing Reconstruction and KL Divergence:** The relative importance of the reconstruction term and the KL divergence term can be adjusted by introducing a weighting factor $\beta$ in front of the KL divergence term.  This leads to the $\beta$-VAE, which can learn disentangled representations of the data.
*   **Implementation details:** When implementing VAEs, it's important to pay attention to numerical stability. For example, when computing the log-likelihood, it's often better to work with log-probabilities to avoid underflow issues.

**How to Narrate**

1.  **Start with the Basics (Context):**

    *   "VAEs are generative models that use variational inference to learn latent representations of data."
    *   "The key is to maximize the likelihood of the observed data, but that's intractable."
    *   "So, we use the ELBO, which is a tractable lower bound on the log-likelihood."

2.  **Derivation (Walk Through):**

    *   "We start with the marginal log-likelihood: $\log p_\theta(x) = \log \int p_\theta(x, z) dz$. Because this integral is intractable, we introduce the variational distribution $q_\phi(z|x)$."
    *   "Using Jensen's inequality, we derive the ELBO as: $\mathcal{L}(\theta, \phi; x) = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q_\phi(z|x)} [\log p_\theta(x|z)] - \text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z))$."
    *   (Write key equations on the whiteboard, if available, while explaining.)

3.  **Components (Explain Clearly):**

    *   "The ELBO has two main components. The first is the reconstruction term, $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim q_\phi(z|x)} [\log p_\theta(x|z)]$, which ensures we can reconstruct the input from the latent representation."
    *   "The second is the KL divergence term, $\text{KL}(q_\phi(z|x) || p_\theta(z))$, which regularizes the latent space by keeping the approximate posterior close to the prior."
