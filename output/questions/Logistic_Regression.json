{"questions": [{"question": "1. Can you provide a high-level overview of logistic regression and explain why the logistic (sigmoid) function is used in place of a linear function in binary classification?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should cover the use of logistic regression for classification tasks, describe the sigmoid function\u2019s property of mapping any real-valued input to a (0, 1) range which works as a probability, and explain that linear functions cannot directly model probabilities while the logistic function can."}, {"question": "2. Derive the likelihood function for logistic regression. Why do we often use the log-likelihood instead of the raw likelihood in optimization?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain the derivation of the likelihood for independent binary outcomes, express the product of probabilities, and note that taking the log transforms the product into a sum, simplifying differentiation and numerical stability during optimization."}, {"question": "3. Describe the cost function used in logistic regression, and explain how it is derived from the log-likelihood. What are some of the key properties of this cost function?", "response_guideline": "A complete answer will detail how the negative log-likelihood (also called binary cross-entropy loss) is used as a cost function, and mention properties like convexity (for binary classification) which assures a global minimum, smoothness, and differentiability."}, {"question": "4. Discuss the gradient descent algorithm in the context of logistic regression. What are the potential challenges the algorithm may face, and how can these be addressed?", "response_guideline": "An ideal response should outline how the gradients of the cost function are computed and updated iteratively, challenges such as learning rate selection, potential issues with convergence (stalling or oscillation), and propose solutions like adaptive learning rates, momentum, or second-order methods."}, {"question": "5. How would you incorporate regularization (both L1 and L2) into the logistic regression model? What effect does regularization have on the model parameters and overall model performance?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain how the regularization terms are added to the cost function (e.g., L2 adds the squared norm of the weights, while L1 promotes sparsity). They should discuss how regularization helps prevent overfitting, can aid in feature selection (especially L1), and trade-offs in bias vs variance."}, {"question": "6. Explain how you would compute and interpret the odds ratio in the context of logistic regression. What are its limitations in various contexts?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should define the odds ratio in terms of the logistic coefficient, explain its interpretation as the multiplicative change in odds for a unit change in the predictor, and discuss pitfalls such as misinterpretation in the presence of confounders or non-linearity."}, {"question": "7. Logistic regression is based on certain assumptions. What are these assumptions, and how can violations of these assumptions affect model performance?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention assumptions like linearity in the log-odds, independence of errors, absence of multicollinearity, balanced classes ideally, and note that violation of these can lead to biased, inefficient, or unstable estimates."}, {"question": "8. In scenarios with imbalanced datasets, logistic regression may produce biased results. How would you address class imbalance when deploying a logistic regression model?", "response_guideline": "A strong candidate should discuss techniques like adjusting class weights, using oversampling or undersampling, threshold moving, or applying evaluation metrics that account for imbalance, such as precision, recall, and the F1 score."}, {"question": "9. How would you approach implementing logistic regression on very large-scale datasets? What computational strategies or approximations might you use to ensure scalability?", "response_guideline": "The response should cover aspects like stochastic gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent, parallel and distributed computing frameworks, use of out-of-core learning, and even approximations or dimensionality reduction to manage computational cost."}, {"question": "10. Describe a real-world scenario where logistic regression might struggle due to messy or noisy data. How would you preprocess or modify your modeling approach to handle these challenges?", "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should address issues like missing values, outliers, and noise in the data, propose solutions such as robust preprocessing (imputation, normalization), feature engineering, and possibly employing regularization or ensemble methods to mitigate these problems."}, {"question": "11. Compare gradient descent with second-order optimization methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson) in the context of logistic regression. Under what circumstances might you prefer one over the other?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss the differences in computational complexity (first-order vs second-order derivatives), convergence speed, and how Newton-Raphson can provide faster convergence near the optimum for small to medium datasets, while gradient descent is often preferred for large datasets due to its lower per-iteration cost."}, {"question": "12. Logistic regression models produce probabilities for binary outcomes. How would you calibrate these probabilities if you suspect that they are poorly calibrated, and why is calibration important?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer would mention calibration techniques such as Platt scaling or isotonic regression, discuss importance in decision-making, risk assessment, and how well-calibrated probabilities affect the interpretation and utility of the model outputs."}, {"question": "13. Discuss potential pitfalls when interpreting logistic regression coefficients, especially in the presence of correlated predictors or non-linear relationships between predictors and the log-odds.", "response_guideline": "An ideal response should address multicollinearity issues affecting coefficient estimates, difficulties in causal interpretation, and mention how techniques such as variance inflation factor (VIF) assessment or transformation (e.g., polynomial terms, splines) can help address these issues."}]}
