{"questions": [{"question": "1. Explain the fundamental concept of the Naive Bayes classifier and its underlying assumptions. How does it utilize Bayes' theorem in classification tasks?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should clearly explain Bayes' theorem, the conditional independence assumption between features, and how these lead to a fast, probabilistic classification method. The candidate should mention that despite its 'naive' assumption, NB can perform well in practice."}, {"question": "2. Derive the Naive Bayes classification formula starting from the general Bayes' theorem. What simplifications are made, and why are they important?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should start with P(C|X) = [P(X|C)P(C)]/P(X) and explain how the likelihood term P(X|C) is decomposed into the product of individual feature probabilities due to the independence assumption. Emphasis on the simplification which leads to computational efficiency should be included."}, {"question": "3. What are the key differences between Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers? In which scenarios might each variant be most appropriate?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should cover the type of feature distribution each variant assumes: Gaussian for continuous data, Multinomial for count data (often used in text classification), and Bernoulli for binary features. Appropriate real-world applications for each example should be mentioned."}, {"question": "4. Discuss how you would handle zero probability issues in Naive Bayes models, particularly when encountering features not seen in training.", "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention techniques such as Laplace (add-one) smoothing or other smoothing methods and explain how they prevent the multiplication of zeros that would otherwise nullify the likelihood."}, {"question": "5. What are the implications of the conditional independence assumption in Naive Bayes, and how does its violation affect the model\u2019s performance?", "response_guideline": "An ideal answer should explain that the assumption leads to simpler computations but is rarely true in practice. However, the model can still perform competitively especially on tasks with weak feature dependencies. Discussion on potential degradation of performance when features are highly correlated is important."}, {"question": "6. Compare Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the context of parameter estimation for Naive Bayes. When might one be preferred over the other?", "response_guideline": "The answer should discuss the differences between MLE and MAP, noting that MLE estimates parameters solely from data while MAP incorporates prior beliefs. Discussion of scenarios with limited data where incorporating priors via MAP can be advantageous is needed."}, {"question": "7. How would you handle messy or incomplete data when training a Naive Bayes classifier? Describe any techniques or methods you would use.", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss data cleaning steps such as imputation for missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring that feature distributions remain valid for the assumptions of Naive Bayes. Mentioning robustness techniques and preprocessing adjustments tailored for Naive Bayes adds depth."}, {"question": "8. In terms of computational complexity, how does Naive Bayes compare with other popular classification algorithms? What makes it particularly scalable for large datasets?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should discuss that Naive Bayes has linear training and prediction time relative to the number of features and samples because of the independence assumption. Comparisons with more computationally intensive models such as SVMs or neural networks might be expected."}, {"question": "9. Describe a scenario in a real-world application (e.g., spam filtering, sentiment analysis) where Naive Bayes might fail. What modifications or alternative approaches could you consider?", "response_guideline": "The answer should identify cases where feature interdependencies or non-representative training data could lead to poor performance. Discussion might involve hybrid models, feature engineering enhancements, or even switching to models that better handle dependencies. A reflective evaluation on edge cases and data characteristics is expected."}, {"question": "10. Explain how you would integrate Naive Bayes into a production system. Consider the challenges that might arise in terms of scalability, model updates, and deployment.", "response_guideline": "Candidates should highlight steps such as pre-training pipelines, real-time scoring mechanisms, monitoring model performance, and strategies for incremental learning. They should also mention how the computational efficiency of NB can be leveraged for high-throughput systems, along with potential pitfalls like concept drift."}, {"question": "11. How does the choice of feature extraction impact the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier in text classification tasks? Discuss the importance of techniques like TF-IDF versus simple bag-of-words.", "response_guideline": "The answer should articulate the implications of different feature representations on probability estimates. Detailed discussion should include trade-offs between preserving contextual information and simplifying assumptions, along with the impact on the independence assumption."}, {"question": "12. Can you discuss how kernel density estimation might be used in the context of Naive Bayes for modeling continuous features? What are the pros and cons compared to assuming a Gaussian distribution?", "response_guideline": "An advanced answer should discuss how kernel density estimation provides a non-parametric way to estimate feature distributions for Naive Bayes, potentially capturing more complex distribution shapes than a single Gaussian. Pros include flexibility; cons include increased computational cost and potential overfitting."}]}
