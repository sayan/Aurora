        {
            "question": "1. Can you explain the core concept of Conditional GANs and how they differ from traditional GANs?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should cover the basic architecture of GANs, highlighting the role of the generator and discriminator, and explain how conditional information (e.g., class labels or other side information) is incorporated into both networks. The answer should include discussion on conditioning mechanisms and benefits such as more controlled output generation."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. Mathematically, how is conditional information integrated into the GAN objective functions? Please describe the modifications to both the generator and discriminator loss functions.",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer would detail the standard GAN minimax objective and then show how additional conditioning variables (often denoted as y) are concatenated or embedded into the input of both generator and discriminator. The candidate might mention modifications such as incorporating the condition into both the input noise vector and in a concatenated form or via an embedding layer. Mathematical formulation, notation clarity, and discussion of implications on the optimization process are expected."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Conditional GANs, like traditional GANs, can suffer from issues such as mode collapse. What strategies would you employ specifically for conditional GANs to mitigate mode collapse, and what are the potential pitfalls of these approaches?",
            "response_guideline": "The response should explore various techniques such as feature matching, minibatch discrimination, or using auxiliary classifiers (AC-GAN) to stabilize training. The candidate should discuss strategies that work when conditions are added, including potential trade-offs like loss of diversity or overfitting on certain classes. A thoughtful discussion of pitfalls such as condition imbalance or the risk of the discriminator becoming too strong is expected."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. In scenarios where the provided conditional data is imbalanced or noisy, how would you modify the training process of a Conditional GAN to ensure robust and meaningful generation?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should demonstrate awareness of real-world data challenges, suggesting methods like data augmentation, reweighting samples, or even designing robust conditioning mechanisms. Discussion might involve pre-processing steps, loss function modifications, and strategies for handling mislabeled or partially missing conditions. A good answer would evaluate both theoretical and practical implications."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. How would you design a system to scale the training and deployment of Conditional GANs, especially when working with large and messy datasets? Consider resource constraints and real-time inference challenges.",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should address issues such as distributed training, use of specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs/TPUs), and optimization techniques. The candidate should also discuss potential pipeline designs for data cleaning, model monitoring, and deploying models in production. Mentioning techniques like incremental learning, transfer learning, or efficient hyperparameter search would further demonstrate a strong practical approach."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Discuss the theoretical challenges in proving the convergence of Conditional GANs. What aspects of the conditional setup complicate the analysis compared to vanilla GANs?",
            "response_guideline": "An excellent answer should cover ideas from game theory and non-convex optimization, explaining why convergence proofs for GANs are already challenging and how adding conditioning variables further complicates stability analysis. The candidate should mention the issues related to balancing the generator and discriminator, the effects of high-dimensional conditional spaces, and any recent research addressing these theoretical challenges."
