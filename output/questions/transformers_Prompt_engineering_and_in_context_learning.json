        {
            "question": "1. Can you explain the concept of prompt engineering and why it is crucial in modern language model applications?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should define prompt engineering clearly, discuss its significance in eliciting desired outputs from language models, touch upon iterative refinement of prompts, and mention its role in maximizing model performance and efficiency."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. How does in-context learning differ from traditional training and fine-tuning approaches in machine learning?",
            "response_guideline": "Expect the candidate to highlight that in-context learning involves providing contextual examples in the prompt without parameter updates, as opposed to traditional training which modifies the model weights. They should discuss pros and cons such as flexibility versus the requirement for large models."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. What are some key design principles or strategies you use when crafting effective prompts for in-context learning tasks?",
            "response_guideline": "A thorough answer should mention clarity, specificity, appropriate context length, balanced examples, handling ambiguous instructions, and the iterative nature of prompt engineering. Examples of successful and failed prompts can be discussed."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. Describe a scenario where in-context learning fails to provide the desired result. What steps would you take to diagnose and rectify the issue?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should outline potential causes such as prompt ambiguity, insufficient examples, or context overload. They should discuss debugging by iterative prompt refinement, analyzing token distributions, and possibly leveraging few-shot examples or rewording the prompt."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. What are the mathematical or theoretical insights that help explain why in-context learning works well for large models?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for explanations involving attention mechanisms, implicit meta-learning properties, distributional statistics embedded in large corpora, and potential references to transformer architecture which supports pattern recognition from input-context pairs."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Can you discuss potential pitfalls or edge cases when designing prompts for models deployed in real-world applications, such as handling ambiguous or adversarial prompts?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should mention issues like ambiguity, biases, prompt sensitivity, overfitting to examples, and adversarial manipulation. Discussions on mitigation strategies (e.g., prompt validation and human-in-the-loop systems) are important."
        },
        {
            "question": "7. How would you experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of a given prompt design? What metrics and evaluations would you consider?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention both qualitative and quantitative metrics such as output accuracy, consistency, user satisfaction, variance across multiple runs, and possibly computational efficiency. They may also discuss ablation studies and controlled experiments."
        },
        {
            "question": "8. In the context of messy or unstructured data, how would you adapt your prompt engineering approach to maintain robustness in outputs?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss cleaning or preprocessing steps, designing prompts that incorporate normalization instructions, adding illustrative examples that handle edge cases, and strategies for adapting prompts dynamically based on input complexity."
        },
        {
            "question": "9. When deploying prompt-based systems in production, what scalability issues might arise, and how would you address them?",
            "response_guideline": "Expected answers should cover challenges related to response time, computational cost, prompt length limitations, and managing variability in outputs. Discussion on caching, efficient prompt templates, and system monitoring would be favorable."
        },
        {
            "question": "10. How do you approach the problem of prompt sensitivity where small changes in wording lead to large changes in outputs, and what methods can be used to stabilize performance?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for discussion of sensitivity analysis, prompt ensembling, robust phrasing, and possibly techniques such as controlled natural language approaches. Consideration of diverse testing and robustness checks should be noted."
        },
        {
            "question": "11. Can you illustrate with an example how you would use few-shot examples within a prompt to improve in-context learning across different tasks?",
            "response_guideline": "A thoughtful answer might involve a detailed walk-through of designing a prompt that contains a few illustrative examples and explaining how those examples teach the model the desired format. Clear explanation of why these examples help and how they are selected is key."
        },
        {
            "question": "12. Discuss the potential ethical and reliability considerations in deploying prompt-engineered models, especially given that prompts can sometimes inadvertently induce biased or misleading outputs.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention ethical guidelines, the risk of bias amplification, the importance of prompt auditability, fairness testing, and methods to monitor, flag, or mitigate problematic outputs in production systems."
