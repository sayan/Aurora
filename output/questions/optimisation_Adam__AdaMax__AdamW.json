            "question": "1. Can you explain the Adam optimization algorithm, detailing how it combines the concepts of momentum and adaptive learning rates? What role do the bias correction terms play in this algorithm?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should articulate that Adam maintains moving averages of both the gradients and their squares, serving as estimates of first and second moments. They should discuss the need for bias correction, especially in the early stages when these estimates are initialized at zero, and compare Adam\u2019s approach with classic SGD."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. Compare and contrast Adam with AdaMax. What modification does AdaMax introduce, and how does this alteration affect the stability and convergence properties of the optimizer, especially in the presence of large gradients or ill-conditioned problems?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should explain that AdaMax is a variant of Adam that replaces the L2 norm used for the second moment estimate with the L\u221e norm, leading to different scaling of the learning rates. The candidate should discuss the mathematical underpinning of using the L\u221e norm and how this can result in enhanced stability under certain conditions."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Describe the implementation of weight decay in Adam and explain the issues associated with its naive incorporation. How does AdamW modify this approach? Discuss the implications of decoupling weight decay from the gradient update in terms of both optimization dynamics and model generalization.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention that traditional implementations of weight decay in Adam add the weight decay term directly to the gradient update, conflating regularization with adaptive gradient scaling. They should explain that AdamW decouples weight decay from the gradient update, leading to a more straightforward and effective regularization that often results in better generalization. Mathematical clarity on how the update rules differ is a plus."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. Optimizers like Adam and its variants are sensitive to hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the beta coefficients. How would you approach tuning these parameters, and what pitfalls might arise during the process? Consider potential issues such as overfitting, convergence instability, and the effect of these hyperparameters on different data regimes.",
            "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should cover strategies such as grid search, learning rate schedulers, and adaptive techniques. The candidate should identify common pitfalls, such as setting beta values too high or low, and discuss the balance between exploration and exploitation. Mentioning potential changes in optimizer behavior in non-stationary or noisy data scenarios would be an advantage."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. Suppose you are deploying a machine learning model on streaming, noisy data in a production environment. Given the characteristics of Adam, AdaMax, and AdamW, how would you choose an optimizer for this scenario? Discuss aspects related to scalability, robustness to noise, and handling of non-stationary data.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate\u2019s answer should integrate practical considerations including computational efficiency and scalability, robustness to noise through adaptivity, and regularization benefits. They should compare how each optimizer might perform under real-world conditions, and justify a choice based on trade-offs observed in empirical studies or theoretical properties."
