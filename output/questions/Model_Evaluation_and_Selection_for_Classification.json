{"questions": [{"question": "What are the main metrics for evaluating classification models, and how do they differ?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should cover metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. The candidate should be able to explain the importance of each metric in different contexts and potentially discuss trade-offs."}, {"question": "Explain the concepts of overfitting and underfitting. How can you identify these issues in your classification models?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss the characteristics of overfitting and underfitting, including performance on training vs testing datasets. They should mention techniques for diagnosis, like learning curves, and might suggest solutions such as regularization or cross-validation."}, {"question": "Describe the differences between k-fold cross-validation and stratified k-fold cross-validation. Why might one be preferred over the other?", "response_guideline": "A solid response should clarify the difference in sampling, particularly how stratification ensures each fold is representative of the whole dataset. The candidate should provide scenarios where using one method is more beneficial than the other, particularly with imbalanced datasets."}, {"question": "What are some methods to handle class imbalance in a classification task?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss techniques like resampling (either oversampling minority classes or undersampling majority classes), using more sophisticated algorithms that handle imbalance (like certain ensemble methods), or applying cost-sensitive learning. Examples should illustrate their reasoning."}, {"question": "Can you explain the ROC curve and the AUC metric? How would you use them in the context of model evaluation?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should include an explanation of the ROC curve as a plot of true positive rate vs false positive rate at various thresholds, alongside a discussion of AUC as a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes. Candidates should emphasize interpretations and thresholds."}, {"question": "How do you choose an appropriate threshold for class predictions when evaluating a classification model?", "response_guideline": "Responses should include discussions on the importance of precision-recall trade-offs, the potential impact on business objectives, and techniques for threshold optimization, such as maximizing F1 score or optimizing for specific metrics as required by different use cases."}, {"question": "What is a confusion matrix? How can you use it to diagnose and improve a classification model?", "response_guideline": "A solid answer should encompass the structure of a confusion matrix and interpretation of its components, followed by insights on how it highlights model weaknesses\u2014like false positives and false negatives\u2014and leads to targeted improvements."}, {"question": "Discuss how you would evaluate a model's performance in the presence of noisy labels. What approaches can mitigate the effects of this noise?", "response_guideline": "An excellent candidate should mention diagnostics for detecting noise, potential impacts on evaluation metrics, and suggest approaches like robust loss functions, noisy label correction methods, or ensemble techniques to combat noise-related issues."}, {"question": "What are ensemble methods in classification, and how do they improve model performance?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should provide definitions and examples of ensemble methods such as bagging (e.g., Random Forest) and boosting (e.g., AdaBoost), explaining how combining multiple models can lead to better predictions than individual models and discussing their applicability."}, {"question": "Consider a scenario where you have a decay in model performance in production. How would you go about diagnosing and rectifying this issue?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should outline a systematic approach for diagnosing issues, which might include analyzing input data changes, feature drift, retraining methods, or model monitoring. They should emphasize practical considerations for deploying and maintaining models."}, {"question": "What are some common pitfalls in model evaluation that practitioners should be aware of?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should identify pitfalls such as relying solely on accuracy in imbalanced datasets, misunderstanding metrics without contextual awareness, or neglecting proper validation techniques. They should provide examples of how these pitfalls can lead to poor decisions."}, {"question": "Explain how hyperparameter tuning can affect the selection of classification models. What strategies might you employ to optimize hyperparameters?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer would present the significance of hyperparameters in model performance. Candidates should mention methods such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization, along with the impact of cross-validation on tuning outcomes."}, {"question": "How would you approach model selection when you have multiple models performing similarly in terms of metrics?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss considerations for model selection beyond evaluation metrics, such as interpretability, inference time, scalability, and alignment with business objectives. They may discuss the importance of conducting a cost-benefit analysis."}, {"question": "In what scenarios would you prioritize interpretability over accuracy in a classification model?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should highlight situations like healthcare or finance, where trust in the model and understanding decisions are critical. Candidates should discuss tools and techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) used to interpret complex models while considering potential trade-offs."}]}
