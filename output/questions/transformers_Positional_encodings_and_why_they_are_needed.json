        {
            "question": "1. What are positional encodings in the context of transformer models, and why are they necessary?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should explain that transformers lack recurrence or convolution, making them order-agnostic. Positional encodings inject information about the sequence order, ensuring that the model can distinguish between different positions in the input sequence. The candidate should mention that without positional encodings, the transformer would treat a permutation of the input similarly."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. Compare and contrast fixed (e.g., sinusoidal) positional encodings with learned positional embeddings. Under what circumstances might one be preferred over the other?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should include the technical differences: fixed encodings are deterministic and based on mathematical functions (such as sine and cosine), providing extrapolation to longer sequences; learned embeddings are parameters learned from data and may capture more complex patterns but might struggle with extrapolation. Evaluation should cover trade-offs in generalization, interpretability, and computational efficiency."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Explain the mathematical intuition behind sinusoidal positional encodings. Why are sine and cosine functions used at different frequencies?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong response will discuss how the sine and cosine functions allow for encoding positions as continuous signals, where different frequencies capture different granularities of positional information. The candidate should mention that the design allows easy computation of relative position by linear functions, and the use of periodic functions facilitates the model's ability to generalize to longer sequences."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. How do positional encodings integrate with the self-attention mechanism in transformers? Please provide a mathematical explanation or formulation if possible.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain that positional encodings are added to the input embeddings before entering the self-attention layers. They should highlight how the added positional information modifies the key, query, and value representations, allowing the attention mechanism to consider position. A mathematical formulation showing the addition of positional encodings to token embeddings and its impact on similarity computations will demonstrate depth."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. What are relative positional encodings, and how do they differ from absolute positional encodings in practice?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should describe relative positional encodings as methods that encode the distance or relation between tokens rather than their absolute positions. This approach is beneficial when the model needs to be invariant to shifts in position (e.g., for tasks requiring translation invariance). The candidate should compare advantages, including better handling of longer or variable sequences."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Can you provide practical examples or scenarios where the lack of positional information in model inputs would lead to failures in task performance?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should include examples such as language modeling, machine translation, or document classification, where token order is crucial. The candidate should also discuss scenarios in other modalities, like time-series analysis or even videos, where the sequential order is key for model performance."
        },
        {
            "question": "7. In handling variable-length inputs or sequences extending beyond the training distribution, what modifications or techniques might be needed for positional encodings?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should explore techniques such as scaling positional encodings, extrapolation strategies, or the use of relative positional encodings that naturally accommodate variable lengths. Discussion on how fixed encodings (e.g., sinusoidal) provide a degree of extrapolation, while learned positional embeddings may require retraining or interpolation, is expected."
        },
        {
            "question": "8. Discuss challenges and considerations when integrating positional encodings in multimodal architectures, for instance, combining text with image features.",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should highlight the difficulty of aligning different modalities that might have different spatial or temporal structures. The candidate should discuss possible approaches including separate encoding schemes for different modalities and strategies for fusing these encodings, ensuring that cross-modal attention mechanisms are effective."
        },
        {
            "question": "9. Propose potential modifications or alternative designs to traditional sinusoidal positional encodings (e.g., using neural networks or discrete position buckets). What are the trade-offs of these methods?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss innovations such as learned encodings, adaptive positional representations, or hierarchical approaches. They should evaluate the trade-offs, such as improved flexibility versus the risk of overfitting and increased computational complexity or reduced generalization to out-of-distribution sequence lengths."
        },
        {
            "question": "10. In a real-world scenario, how would you handle noisy or incomplete sequence data where positional information might be corrupted or missing?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should include a strategy for robust encoding, such as data augmentation, robust interpolation methods, or modifications to the encoding mechanism to account for noise. The candidate should mention potential fallback strategies and integration with error correction or smoothing techniques."
        },
        {
            "question": "11. Describe a potential pitfall when implementing positional encodings in a new or hybrid architecture (for example, a CNN-transformer fusion). How would you identify and mitigate this issue?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should explore pitfalls such as misalignment between positional scales in different parts of the network or the improper fusion of positional information from disparate sources. The candidate should suggest thorough validation, calibration of input scales, or architectural adjustments to ensure consistency."
        },
        {
            "question": "12. How can positional encodings be adapted or fine-tuned in transfer learning scenarios, especially when moving to a domain with different sequence characteristics?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss strategies like re-learning or fine-tuning positional embeddings, using domain-specific modifications, or employing relative positional encodings to better handle the new domain. They should mention the importance of proper training regime adjustments and validation methods."
        },
        {
            "question": "13. Discuss the implications of positional encodings on model generalization and scalability. Are there any novel approaches you might consider to improve these aspects?",
            "response_guideline": "An ideal answer would demonstrate awareness of how fixed versus learned pos. encodings affect model generalization, particularly when dealing with unseen sequence lengths. The candidate might propose innovative solutions, such as adaptive encoding schemes or hybrid methods, and discuss their potential benefits and risks."
