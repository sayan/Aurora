            "question": "Can you explain the core idea behind Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) and how it differs from standard momentum-based optimization techniques?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should describe the intuition behind NAG, emphasizing the idea of looking ahead by computing the gradient at the approximated future position (i.e., the 'look-ahead' step), as opposed to computing the gradient solely at the current point as in classical momentum. The candidate should mention that this leads to more informed updates and can potentially improve convergence rates."
        },
        {
            "question": "Derive the update equations for Nesterov Accelerated Gradient. How does the mathematical derivation justify the 'look-ahead' concept?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should provide a step-by-step derivation of the NAG update equations. They should start by outlining classical momentum and then modify it to include the 'look-ahead' gradient evaluation. The answer should clarify how evaluating the gradient at the predicted future position improves convergence and explain how the derivation relies on the momentum term and step size."
        },
        {
            "question": "Compare and contrast NAG with traditional momentum methods in the context of convergence behavior, particularly in convex and non-convex settings.",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer will discuss the convergence properties of both methods, highlighting how NAG often achieves accelerated convergence in smooth convex problems due to better anticipation of the trajectory. Additionally, the candidate should mention potential pitfalls in non-convex environments, such as over-acceleration leading to overshooting minima or sensitivity to hyperparameters."
        },
        {
            "question": "In practice, optimization algorithms must be robust to difficulties such as noisy gradients or irregular data distributions. How would you modify or extend NAG to handle such real-world challenges, and what potential issues might arise during deployment in large-scale systems?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should address modifications like adaptive learning rate adjustments, gradient clipping, or incorporating techniques from stochastic optimization to handle noise. They should also consider implementation challenges such as the effect of mini-batch variance, stability in large-scale distributed environments, and potential trade-offs between convergence speed and robustness. Discussion of scalability and hyperparameter tuning strategies will be valued."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some potential pitfalls or limitations of using Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, especially when dealing with highly nonconvex objectives or deep neural networks?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should mention issues such as sensitivity to hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, momentum coefficient), the possibility of overshooting in nonconvex landscapes, and the challenges in tuning the algorithm for deep learning applications. The candidate should also discuss scenarios where the theoretical acceleration may not translate into practical improvements due to the noisy and erratic gradients typical in nonconvex optimization."
        },
        {
            "question": "Discuss how the choice of momentum and learning rate parameters in NAG can affect its performance. How would you go about tuning these parameters for a new problem, and what diagnostic measures would you use to decide if the algorithm is converging appropriately?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain the interactions between momentum and learning rate, emphasizing how these hyperparameters influence the 'look-ahead' behavior and convergence speed. A robust answer will detail systematic tuning strategies such as grid search or adaptive methods, alongside diagnostic measures such as monitoring the loss curve, gradient norms, or other convergence metrics. Discussion on handling cases where convergence stalls or oscillates will demonstrate deep practical insight."
