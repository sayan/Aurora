{"questions": [{"question": "What is Item Response Theory (IRT), and how does it differ from Classical Test Theory (CTT)?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should define IRT and CTT, highlighting IRT\u2019s probabilistic approach to modeling the relationship between latent traits and item responses. The candidate should discuss the advantages of IRT, such as its ability to provide item characteristic curves and to handle varying levels of measurement precision."}, {"question": "Explain the concept of the item characteristic curve (ICC) in IRT. What information does it convey?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should describe the ICC's plot, typically showing the probability of a correct response as a function of the latent trait level. They should explain how different parameters of the ICC indicate item difficulty, discrimination, and guessing."}, {"question": "Discuss the three-parameter logistic (3PL) model of IRT. What are its parameters and what do they represent?", "response_guideline": "A thorough response should indicate that the 3PL model includes three parameters: difficulty (b), discrimination (a), and guessing (c). The candidate should elaborate on each parameter's significance in defining how items function in relation to a respondent's ability."}, {"question": "How do you evaluate the fit of an IRT model? What methods can be used to assess model fit?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention methods such as the likelihood ratio test, chi-square statistics, and information criteria (AIC/BIC). Additionally, they should discuss graphical methods like residual plots and item fit statistics."}, {"question": "Can you describe the significance of the concept of 'local independence' in IRT? Why is it important?", "response_guideline": "A solid answer should define local independence and explain its importance in ensuring that responses to items are not influenced by unobserved traits. Candidates could provide examples of violations of this assumption and how they can affect model results."}, {"question": "What are the assumptions underlying IRT? How might violations of these assumptions affect the results?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss key assumptions such as unidimensionality, local independence, and the adequacy of the model. They should address potential impacts on the validity and reliability of the estimates if these assumptions are violated."}, {"question": "Describe how you would approach analyzing a dataset with missing item responses using IRT. What techniques could you employ?", "response_guideline": "A good answer would discuss techniques such as multiple imputation, full information maximum likelihood, or Bayesian approaches for handling missing data. Candidates should clarify how these methods contribute to recovering valid parameter estimates."}, {"question": "In what scenarios might you choose to use IRT over CTT in assessing test items?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should be able to cite examples where IRT's strengths, such as its ability to provide detailed information about item functioning, are beneficial, such as in adaptive testing or large-scale assessments."}, {"question": "How would you deal with item parameter estimation in a situation where the data is skewed or has outliers?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should demonstrate understanding of robust estimation methods, such as the use of Bayesian estimation techniques that can handle skewed data or modification of maximum likelihood estimation methods to mitigate the impact of outliers."}, {"question": "What are some computational challenges you might face when implementing IRT models in large datasets?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should identify challenges like convergence issues, computations of the likelihood function in high dimensions, and the implications of item response missingness. They should discuss strategies to handle these challenges, such as using efficient algorithms or parallel computing."}, {"question": "Explain how you might apply IRT in the context of adaptive learning systems. What are the benefits of such an approach?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should define adaptive learning and explain how IRT can be used to tailor assessments to individuals' abilities in real-time. Candidates should highlight the advantages such as increased engagement, personalized feedback, and more accurate measurement of learning."}, {"question": "Identify potential ethical considerations when implementing IRT assessments in educational or clinical settings. How would you address these?", "response_guideline": "A thorough response would outline concerns related to fairness, bias in item selection, and the implications of misinterpreting ability estimates. Candidates should discuss the importance of validation studies and transparency in how assessments are used."}, {"question": "How would you visualize the output of an IRT analysis to effectively communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should suggest visualization techniques such as ICC plots, item maps, or ability distributions. They should discuss how to present these visualizations in a user-friendly manner to facilitate understanding of the results."}, {"question": "Discuss an experience where you applied IRT in a real-world project. What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should provide a detailed account of a specific project or experience, focusing on the practical application of IRT, any complexities or unexpected issues encountered, and the methodologies used to address those challenges."}]}
