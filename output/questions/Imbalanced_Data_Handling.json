{"questions": [{"question": "Can you explain why imbalanced datasets can negatively impact machine learning models?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should cover the concept of bias introduced in model training, particularly how the model may overfit to the majority class and underperform on the minority class. Examples of performance metrics that are affected, such as accuracy vs. precision, recall, and F1-score, should also be discussed."}, {"question": "What are some techniques you know for handling imbalanced datasets? Can you explain the benefits and limitations of each?", "response_guideline": "Look for a range of techniques, such as resampling methods (oversampling, undersampling), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), cost-sensitive learning, and ensemble methods. The candidate should describe how each technique works, along with specific scenarios where they are most effective or may fail."}, {"question": "How would you implement SMOTE in a machine learning pipeline? What considerations would you take into account?", "response_guideline": "The response should include a step-by-step explanation of applying SMOTE, such as choosing parameters. The candidate should discuss its impact on the dataset, potential overfitting, and how to balance between the generated synthetic examples and original data."}, {"question": "Describe how to evaluate machine learning models on imbalanced datasets. Which metrics would you prioritize and why?", "response_guideline": "Look for an understanding of metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve, and confusion matrix. A solid answer should elaborate on why these metrics are more informative than accuracy in the context of imbalanced datasets."}, {"question": "Discuss a situation where simply upsampling the minority class isn\u2019t sufficient to improve model performance. How would you address it?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should identify potential issues with upsampling, such as introducing noise or overfitting, and discuss alternative strategies like feature engineering, better algorithms, or combining methods (e.g., SMOTE + ensemble learning)."}, {"question": "Can you explain the concept of 'class weight' in the context of training a model on imbalanced data? How do you choose the right weights?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss how class weights adjust the loss function to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily, helping to mitigate the imbalance issue. They should also discuss methods for determining proper weights, like using the inverse frequency of classes."}, {"question": "Provide an example of a real-world application where you dealt with imbalanced data. What approach did you choose and why?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should describe the context of the problem, the size and nature of the imbalance, the chosen method, and the impact of their approach. Success metrics and model performance before and after handling imbalance should be mentioned."}, {"question": "What are some common pitfalls when handling imbalanced data, especially when applying machine learning techniques?", "response_guideline": "Look for mentions of overfitting, noise introduction, loss of important information from undersampling, and evaluation metric misuse. Candidates should demonstrate critical awareness of how to avoid these pitfalls."}, {"question": "How do you integrate data preprocessing techniques for handling imbalance into a deployment pipeline? What challenges might arise?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss considerations for modeling in an operational environment, such as maintaining data distribution, monitoring model drift, and ensuring efficiency of data processing. Real-world challenges like scalability or resource constraints should be included."}, {"question": "Imagine you are working with a highly imbalanced dataset and you have a limited number of labeled samples for the minority class. How would you approach building a predictive model?", "response_guideline": "Look for a strategic discussion about leveraging semi-supervised learning techniques, using transfer learning, employing generative models, or seeking additional synthetic data. Candidates should also consider the importance of domain knowledge."}, {"question": "What is ensemble learning, and how can it be beneficial for imbalanced datasets? Can you provide examples?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should explain ensemble methods like bagging and boosting, discussing how they can aggregate weak learners effectively. The answer should include specific practices like Balanced Random Forest or AdaBoost with class weight adjustments."}, {"question": "Discuss how you would handle a scenario where a machine learning model trained on an imbalanced dataset performs well on training but poorly on validation. What steps would you take to diagnose the issue?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should talk about checking for overfitting through validation metrics, visualizing confusion matrices, ensuring proper data splitting, and considering the distribution of classes in both training and validation sets."}, {"question": "What role does feature selection play in the context of imbalanced datasets, and how can it impact model performance?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss how irrelevant or redundant features can exacerbate imbalance issues, leading to model bias. Techniques for feature selection that might work better in this context should be mentioned."}, {"question": "Could you explain how deployment considerations differ for models trained on imbalanced datasets compared to balanced datasets?", "response_guideline": "A strong response should highlight aspects like the need for continuous monitoring, the potential for model drift, and the dynamics of incoming data potentially changing class distributions after deployment."}]}
