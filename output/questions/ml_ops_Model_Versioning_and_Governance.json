        {
            "question": "Can you explain the concept of model versioning and why it is critical for AI/ML projects?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should define model versioning, discuss its importance in tracking experiments, reproducing results, and ensuring compliance with governance standards. The candidate should mention aspects such as version identifiers, metadata tracking, and how versioning supports both research and production workflows."
        },
        {
            "question": "How would you design a system to manage and track multiple versions of a model during an iterative development cycle? What considerations would you include for scalability?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should cover architecture choices, such as centralized version control systems (e.g., Git, DVC, MLflow), database schemas for metadata, and strategies for handling large-scale model repositories. They should also discuss scalability challenges, such as storage across different environments, automated tagging, and the synchronization between model artifacts and experiment data."
        },
        {
            "question": "Discuss the importance of model governance and outline the key components that should be included in a robust model governance framework.",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should include key components such as audit trails, compliance with regulatory standards, monitoring of model performance, and risk management. Additional points might cover role-based access control, versioning of both models and data, lifecycle management, and the need for transparency in decision-making processes."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a scenario where metadata on model versions becomes inconsistent or incomplete (for example, due to integration issues with various data sources), how would you approach cleaning and reconciling this information to maintain governance standards?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should illustrate a structured approach to data cleaning, including methods to validate and reconcile metadata, the use of automated scripts or tools, and establishing consistency checks. They should also mention cross-team collaboration to ensure that data standards are met, handle edge cases where metadata is missing, and discuss the impact on governance and reproducibility."
        },
        {
            "question": "Imagine you\u2019re deploying an ML model in a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. How do you ensure that model versioning and governance are maintained consistently throughout the deployment cycle, especially when multiple models are updated frequently?",
            "response_guideline": "A suitable answer should address integration of model versioning into CI/CD pipelines, the use of automated deployment scripts, version tracking in production, rollback mechanisms, and real-time monitoring. Mention of containerization, environment management, and the challenges of synchronizing model updates with business logic is also beneficial."
        },
        {
            "question": "What potential pitfalls might arise from poor model versioning and governance practices, and how can an organization proactively mitigate these risks?",
            "response_guideline": "The response should identify risks such as inability to reproduce results, lack of accountability, non-compliance with regulatory standards, and potential model performance degradation. The candidate should suggest solutions like implementing robust version tracking tools, audits, regular reviews, automated alert systems, and clear documentation practices to mitigate these risks."
