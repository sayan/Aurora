{"questions": [{"question": "What is collaborative filtering and how does it differ from content-based filtering?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should define collaborative filtering and explain its premise, focusing on user-item interactions. The candidate should highlight the difference in approach\u2014collaborative filtering relies on user behavior while content-based filtering uses the characteristics of items."}, {"question": "Explain how user-based collaborative filtering works. What are some common algorithms employed in this method?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should describe the concept of finding similar users based on their preferences and behavior. They should mention algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and user similarity measures such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation."}, {"question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of item-based collaborative filtering compared to user-based?", "response_guideline": "A strong response should discuss advantages like better scalability and less susceptibility to the cold start problem, as well as disadvantages such as potential lack of personalization in recommendations."}, {"question": "What is the cold start problem in collaborative filtering? Can you suggest potential strategies to mitigate this issue?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should define the cold start problem clearly and discuss strategies such as hybrid methods, using content-based filtering for new items, or utilizing demographic information to initiate recommendations."}, {"question": "Describe the Matrix Factorization technique in collaborative filtering. How does it improve recommendation quality?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or similar techniques, discussing how they reduce dimensionality and capture latent factors, thus improving recommendations by providing more personalized user preferences."}, {"question": "Can you describe a scenario where collaborative filtering might fail? What factors could lead to poor recommendations?", "response_guideline": "A solid response should include cases where user behavior is sparse (sparsity issue), or when there are significant changes in user preferences over time, leading to outdated recommendations."}, {"question": "How do you handle implicit feedback in collaborative filtering systems?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention techniques such as treating interaction data (clicks, views) differently from explicit ratings, possibly discussing methods like Bayesian Personalized Ranking or matrix factorization adapted for implicit data."}, {"question": "Discuss how to evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative filtering model. What metrics would you use?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should reference metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as well as ranking-based metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)."}, {"question": "In a production environment, how would you address scalability challenges when implementing a collaborative filtering system?", "response_guideline": "A good response should touch upon issues related to data volume and algorithmic efficiency, mentioning approaches such as approximate nearest neighbors, distributed computing, or online learning strategies."}, {"question": "What are the ethical considerations you must take into account when designing a collaborative filtering system?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should cover issues such as bias in data, privacy concerns, and the potential for creating filter bubbles, discussing strategies to mitigate these risks."}, {"question": "Describe a situation where you had to deal with messy data while implementing a collaborative filtering system. What steps did you take to preprocess the data?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should detail specific types of messiness (like missing values, noise) and outline techniques like imputation, normalization, or using data cleaning libraries to prepare the data for analysis."}, {"question": "How do you think advancements in AI, such as deep learning, could impact the future of collaborative filtering?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should explore potential improvements through neural collaborative filtering models, discussing how these methods can learn more complex patterns from data compared to traditional methods."}, {"question": "What techniques would you use to ensure diversity in recommendations generated by a collaborative filtering system?", "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer could include methods like re-ranking, introducing randomness, or algorithmically balancing popularity and novelty to prevent repetitive recommendations."}, {"question": "How can you integrate contextual information into a collaborative filtering framework? What benefits does this provide?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss how adding context (time, location, user behavior changes) can enhance recommendations, leading to more relevant outputs, and may mention approaches like context-aware collaborative filtering."}]}
