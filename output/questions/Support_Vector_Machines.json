{"questions": [{"question": "1. Can you explain the basic concept of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and describe what is meant by 'maximizing the margin'?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should explain that SVMs are supervised learning models used for classification and regression. The candidate should discuss the idea of finding a hyperplane that separates classes with the maximum possible margin, highlight the importance of support vectors in defining the decision boundary, and mention how maximizing the margin helps improve generalization."}, {"question": "2. What is the difference between hard-margin and soft-margin SVMs, and in what situations would you prefer one over the other?", "response_guideline": "The response should detail that hard-margin SVMs assume completely linearly separable data, while soft-margin SVMs allow misclassifications through slack variables (\u03be). The candidate should discuss trade-offs controlled by the regularization parameter (C) and emphasize that soft-margin is preferred in realistic scenarios with noise or non-separable data."}, {"question": "3. Describe the kernel trick in SVMs. Can you provide examples of different kernels and explain under what circumstances each might be used?", "response_guideline": "The answer should explain that the kernel trick maps data into a higher-dimensional feature space to make it linearly separable without explicit computation. Examples like linear, polynomial, RBF (Gaussian), and sigmoid kernels should be mentioned, along with discussions of their properties, computational implications, and scenarios (e.g., RBF for non-linear separability, linear for high-dimensional sparse data)."}, {"question": "4. How is the optimization problem formulated in SVMs? Please discuss both the primal and dual formulations, touching on the Lagrangian and KKT conditions.", "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should cover the formulation of the primal optimization problem minimizing \u00bd||w||^2 (plus slack penalties if applicable) under linear constraints. The candidate should then explain the derivation of the dual problem using Lagrange multipliers, the role of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, and how these constraints ensure optimality. Mathematical rigor and clarity are important."}, {"question": "5. In practice, how would you handle imbalanced classes when training an SVM model?", "response_guideline": "The answer should mention strategies such as adjusting class weights in the SVM objective function, using different penalty parameters for different classes, resampling techniques (like SMOTE), or even altering the decision threshold. An understanding of cost-sensitive learning and its integration into the SVM framework is expected."}, {"question": "6. SVMs tend to be challenged by large-scale datasets. What techniques or algorithms would you consider to scale SVM training to very large datasets?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should reference algorithmic solutions such as the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm, approximate SVM methods, online learning approaches (like Pegasos), or using stochastic optimization. Discussions on kernel approximations and parallelization strategies to handle computational complexity are also welcome."}, {"question": "7. How does feature scaling impact the performance of an SVM, and what strategies would you employ to ensure that your SVM model is robust to features in different scales?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should stress that SVMs, especially with kernel methods, are sensitive to feature scales. They should advocate for standard normalization techniques like standard scaling (zero mean, unit variance) or min-max normalization. A good answer will also mention that proper scaling can prevent one feature from dominating the distance computations."}, {"question": "8. Describe an approach for handling multi-class classification problems using SVMs. What are the strengths and limitations of these approaches?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention common approaches such as one-vs.-rest (OvR) and one-vs.-one (OvO) strategies. The response should outline how each works, the complexity and computational trade-offs, potential issues with probability estimates, and discuss scenarios where one approach might be preferred over the other."}, {"question": "9. Discuss the implications of high-dimensional, low sample size (HDLSS) scenarios on SVM performance. What specific challenges arise and how might you address them?", "response_guideline": "The answer should indicate that in HDLSS settings, overfitting is a major concern. A good discussion will cover the curse of dimensionality, potential difficulties in choosing the right kernel or tuning parameters, and strategies like dimensionality reduction (PCA), regularization techniques, or feature selection to improve model robustness."}, {"question": "10. Consider a real-world application where you have noisy data with overlapping classes. What modifications to the standard SVM formulation would you consider to improve performance?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should acknowledge the issues brought by noise and overlapping classes by recommending the use of soft-margin SVM with careful tuning of the regularization parameter (C) and possibly different loss functions. Discussion may also include robust loss formulations, outlier detection, or kernel adjustments to better model the data distribution."}, {"question": "11. How would you approach hyperparameter tuning for an SVM model in a production environment, especially considering scalability and deployment constraints?", "response_guideline": "A thorough answer should touch upon methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, while also considering cross-validation strategies to balance performance and computational load. The candidate might also discuss automating the tuning process and considerations for model retraining and deployment monitoring."}, {"question": "12. Can you explain how Support Vector Regression (SVR) differs from the classification SVM, and in what scenarios would SVR be particularly useful?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should explain that SVR adapts the SVM framework for regression tasks, employing an \u03b5-insensitive loss function. The discussion should include how the margin is defined in a regression context, the role of slack variables, and practical scenarios where predicting continuous outcomes is essential, emphasizing robustness to outliers."}, {"question": "13. Derive the dual problem formulation from the primal SVM optimization problem step-by-step, and explain where and how the slack variables are incorporated when dealing with non-separable data.", "response_guideline": "This advanced question expects a detailed mathematical derivation. The candidate should start from the primal formulation with slack variables (for soft-margin SVMs), introduce the Lagrangian with appropriate multipliers, derive the dual formulation, and explain how the constraints (including KKT conditions) integrate the effect of slack variables. Rigor, clarity, and correct handling of the derivation process are key."}]}
