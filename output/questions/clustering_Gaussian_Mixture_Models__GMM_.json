        {
            "question": "1. What is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and how does it differ from simpler clustering methods such as k-means?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should define GMM as a probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each with its own mean and covariance. The candidate should highlight that GMM provides soft assignments (probabilistic membership) as opposed to k-means which gives hard assignments, and mention the ability of GMM to capture different covariance structures."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. What are the underlying assumptions of GMMs, and how do these assumptions impact their performance in practice?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for an explanation that discusses assumptions such as the data being generated by a mixture of Gaussians, independence among data points, and the specification of covariance structures (full, diagonal, spherical). A good answer should also cover situations where these assumptions might be violated and the effects on model performance."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Write down the likelihood function for a Gaussian Mixture Model and explain the role of the latent variables.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should derive the likelihood as a weighted sum of Gaussian probability density functions for each component. They must mention the mixing coefficients and latent variables, usually represented by indicators, that denote the membership of each data point to a specific Gaussian component."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. Can you derive the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for GMMs, detailing the steps in both the E-step and the M-step?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should articulate the EM algorithm steps: In the E-step, compute the posterior probabilities (responsibilities) for each Gaussian component for every data point. In the M-step, update the parameters (means, covariances, and mixing coefficients) using these responsibilities. A rigorous explanation including the derivation of update formulas is expected."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. How does the initialization of parameters in a GMM influence the convergence of the EM algorithm? What strategies do you recommend for initialization?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should cover the sensitivity of the EM algorithm to initial parameter settings, potential issues like converging to local optima, and strategies such as multiple random initializations, k-means based initialization, or using prior domain knowledge to set initial values."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. In practical applications, what common pitfalls or challenges (e.g., singular covariance matrices) have you encountered when fitting GMMs, and how can they be mitigated?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention pitfalls such as singular covariance matrices or degenerate solutions, particularly in high-dimensional settings or when a cluster has very few data points. Mitigation strategies like adding a regularization term (a small value to the diagonal of covariance matrices) or using robust estimation methods should be discussed."
        },
        {
            "question": "7. How do you determine the optimal number of components in a GMM for a given dataset?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should reference model selection criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), or cross-validation methods. Discussion of trade-offs between model complexity and overfitting is expected."
        },
        {
            "question": "8. Explain the differences between using full, diagonal, and spherical covariance matrices in GMMs. What are the trade-offs of each approach?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should clearly differentiate that full covariance matrices allow for modeling correlations among features, diagonal assumes independence between features (reducing the number of parameters), and spherical assumes identical variance in all dimensions. Trade-offs include computational complexity versus model flexibility and the risk of overfitting."
        },
        {
            "question": "9. How can GMMs be used to model and represent multi-modal distributions? Provide an example of a scenario where this capability is beneficial.",
            "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should explain that GMMs, through their mixture of components, naturally model data with multiple modes. An example might include speech or image data where different clusters represent different classes or modes of behavior, emphasizing how GMMs can capture complex distributions beyond unimodal assumptions."
        },
        {
            "question": "10. Discuss how you would incorporate Bayesian priors into the GMM framework. What are the benefits of adopting a Bayesian approach?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for an explanation covering Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) where prior distributions are placed over parameters like the means, covariances, and mixing coefficients. The advantages, such as regularization, improved uncertainty quantification, and potentially better performance in small sample situations, should be emphasized."
        },
        {
            "question": "11. How do GMMs scale to high-dimensional and large-scale datasets? What are potential strategies for dealing with scalability challenges?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss the computational cost of the EM algorithm in high-dimensional data, mention dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA), or scalable approximations (e.g., using mini-batch EM, sampling methods, or distributed computing frameworks) as remedies for scalability problems."
        },
        {
            "question": "12. In a real-world scenario with messy or noisy data (including outliers and missing values), how would you adapt the GMM framework to handle these challenges?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer will consider robust statistical methods or modifications to the standard GMM, such as using regularized covariances, incorporating outlier detection mechanisms, modifying the model (for example, adding an extra component to model outliers), or using imputation techniques for missing data. An understanding of the limitations of GMM in these contexts and potential preprocessing steps is key."
