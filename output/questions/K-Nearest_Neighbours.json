{"questions": [{"question": "What is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and how does it work?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain the basic principles of KNN\u2014how it classifies data points by measuring the distance to 'K' closest training examples in the feature space, using metrics like Euclidean or Manhattan distance."}, {"question": "How do you choose the value of K in KNN, and what impact does it have on the model's performance?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should discuss the trade-off between bias and variance, the potential overfitting with low K values and underfitting with high K values, as well as techniques such as cross-validation to find the optimal K."}, {"question": "What distance metrics can be used in KNN, and how do they affect the results?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention various distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski, Hamming, etc.) and how choosing a different metric changes the classification performance for various datasets."}, {"question": "Explain the concept of the curse of dimensionality in the context of KNN. How can it affect the accuracy of the algorithm?", "response_guideline": "Look for insights on how high-dimensional data can lead to sparsity, making distance measures less effective, and how it can negatively impact the performance of KNN."}, {"question": "How does KNN handle categorical features? Are there any specific considerations you must keep in mind?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should indicate methods for encoding categorical variables (like one-hot encoding) and discuss potential issues with distance metrics when dealing with non-numeric data."}, {"question": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of using KNN as a classification algorithm?", "response_guideline": "A proficient candidate should provide a balanced view, including strengths (simple to understand and implement, no assumptions about data distribution) and weaknesses (computationally expensive, sensitive to irrelevant features, etc.)."}, {"question": "Describe how you would implement KNN in a scenario with imbalanced classes. What strategies could be implemented?", "response_guideline": "Good candidates should mention techniques such as adjusting K, using weighted distances, oversampling the minority class, or undersampling the majority class."}, {"question": "Can you discuss a method to improve the efficiency of KNN for very large datasets?", "response_guideline": "Expect mentions of dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA), using approximate nearest neighbors (ANN), or data structures like KD-trees or Ball-trees to improve speed."}, {"question": "How would you handle missing values in the dataset before applying KNN?", "response_guideline": "A good answer may include strategies such as imputation (mean, median, or mode imputation), or using techniques like KNN imputation before applying the algorithm for classification."}, {"question": "Provide an example of a real-world application of KNN. What challenges did you face during its implementation?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss a specific example, ideally from their experience, and cover challenges like handling high-dimensional data, deciding on K, or computational constraints."}, {"question": "What considerations would you keep in mind when deploying a KNN model in production?", "response_guideline": "Look for factors such as model retraining, scalability of processing new data, monitoring performance over time, and the potential need for online vs. batch processing."}, {"question": "How do you evaluate the performance of a KNN model? What metrics would you use?", "response_guideline": "A good candidate should reference metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and potentially ROC-AUC, explaining why these metrics might be relevant depending on the application."}, {"question": "What are some methods to mitigate the impact of noisy data on KNN?", "response_guideline": "Answers should include techniques like data preprocessing (cleaning, normalization), using a larger K value, or employing feature selection methods to reduce noise."}, {"question": "What is the effect of feature scaling in KNN, and when would you consider it necessary?", "response_guideline": "Here, candidates should explain how KNN is sensitive to the scale of features (as distance calculations can be skewed) and the importance of normalization or standardization before fitting the model."}, {"question": "Can you explain how KNN could be adapted for regression tasks? What are the differences compared to classification?", "response_guideline": "Look for explanations of how KNN can be used to predict continuous values by averaging the outcomes of the nearest neighbors, and how this relates to metrics used to measure performance."}]}
