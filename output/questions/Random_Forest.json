{"questions": [{"question": "1. Can you explain what a Random Forest is and describe its key components and overall working mechanism?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should describe Random Forest as an ensemble of decision trees built using bootstrapped samples and random feature selection, explain how trees are aggregated (e.g., majority voting for classification, averaging for regression), and discuss the benefits of reducing variance compared to single decision trees."}, {"question": "2. How does the Out-of-Bag (OOB) error estimate work in Random Forest, and what assumptions underlie this method?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should explain that OOB error is calculated using the samples not included in the bootstrap for each tree, discuss how it provides an unbiased estimate of generalization error, and mention any assumptions such as independence between trees and that the out-of-bag samples adequately represent the training distribution."}, {"question": "3. Describe the concept of feature importance in Random Forest. What are the differences between Gini importance and permutation importance, and what are their respective pitfalls?", "response_guideline": "Look for explanations that cover how Gini importance (or Mean Decrease in Impurity) is calculated, and contrast it with permutation importance which measures the decrease in model performance when feature values are permuted. The candidate should discuss biases (e.g., Gini importance favoring continuous or high-cardinality features) and the computational cost associated with permutation importance."}, {"question": "4. How does Random Forest reduce the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree? What role does randomness play in this context?", "response_guideline": "A strong answer should explain that ensemble methods reduce variance through averaging, discuss the introduction of randomness via bootstrapping and random feature selection at splits, and mention how these mechanisms reduce tree correlation, thereby helping to mitigate overfitting."}, {"question": "5. What are the key hyperparameters in a Random Forest model, and how do they influence both model performance and computational complexity?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, minimum samples per split, maximum features per split, and explain trade-offs regarding bias-variance, model interpretability, and computational cost. They should also discuss methods for tuning these parameters."}, {"question": "6. In implementing Random Forest for a large-scale dataset, what strategies would you adopt to handle scalability and what are the challenges you might face?", "response_guideline": "Expect a discussion on parallel training of trees (possibly using distributed computing frameworks), memory management, handling I/O and data storage, and balance between computational resources and accuracy. The candidate should also consider potential bottlenecks such as data preprocessing and integration with deployment pipelines."}, {"question": "7. How would you handle missing data and noisy features when training a Random Forest model? What potential pitfalls should be considered?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should cover strategies such as data imputation (mean, median, model-based), using Random Forest's robust nature to missing data, and careful preprocessing of noisy features. They should also discuss potential biases that might be introduced by imputation techniques and how to validate model robustness."}, {"question": "8. Discuss how the randomness in feature selection at each split impacts the diversity and correlation of trees in a Random Forest, and why is this important?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss that random feature selection reduces correlation between trees, which in turn reduces variance when aggregating predictions. A nuanced answer might explore scenarios where features are highly correlated and how this might still affect the ensemble performance, possibly diminishing the benefits of the randomness."}, {"question": "9. Could you derive or outline the mathematical intuition behind variance reduction in a Random Forest when it comes to ensemble averaging?", "response_guideline": "A strong candidate should articulate the concept of variance reduction by averaging independent (or partially correlated) estimators, providing a trade-off between bias and variance. They might provide an informal derivation or reference the law of large numbers and the reduction of variance proportional to 1/T (number of trees), as long as the trees are not fully correlated."}, {"question": "10. In what scenarios might a Random Forest underperform compared to other models such as gradient boosting machines or neural networks, and what factors contribute to this underperformance?", "response_guideline": "A well-rounded answer should consider dataset characteristics (e.g., high-dimensional sparse data, extremely large feature spaces), overfitting when features are highly correlated, lack of fine-grained tuning compared to gradient boosting, and the inability to capture complex non-linear relationships as effectively as neural networks in some settings."}, {"question": "11. What could happen if the number of trees in a Random Forest is too high or too low? Describe the trade-offs and practical implications of setting this hyperparameter incorrectly.", "response_guideline": "The candidate should note that too few trees can lead to high variance and poor generalization performance, while too many trees increase computational cost and may cause diminishing returns in variance reduction. They should discuss how to balance these trade-offs, possibly using OOB error or cross-validation to select the optimal number."}]}
