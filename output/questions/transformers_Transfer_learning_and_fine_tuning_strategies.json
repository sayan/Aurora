        {
            "question": "Can you explain the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning, and provide examples of scenarios where each is applicable?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should differentiate transfer learning (reuse of a pre-trained model's knowledge for a new task) from fine-tuning (adjusting the model weights on the new task data), with clear examples such as applying a CNN trained on ImageNet to medical imaging vs. fine-tuning language models for sentiment analysis."
        },
        {
            "question": "How would you decide which layers of a pre-trained network to freeze and which to fine-tune when adapting the model to a new task?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should include factors such as the similarity between the source and target tasks, the amount of available target data, computational cost, and discussion about feature extraction versus full fine-tuning. Mention techniques like layer-wise learning rate adjustments."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the potential risks of fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a dataset that is very different from the original training data, and how do you mitigate them?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss issues like negative transfer, catastrophic forgetting, and overfitting. Measures might include careful layer freezing, using a smaller learning rate, or even employing domain adaptation techniques. The answer should reflect both theoretical understanding and practical mitigation strategies."
        },
        {
            "question": "Describe how you would approach fine-tuning a model when you have limited labeled data for the target task.",
            "response_guideline": "Look for discussion around data augmentation, regularization techniques, early stopping, leveraging unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, and possibly using few-shot or meta-learning approaches. The candidate should also mention the trade-off between freezing more layers versus risk of overfitting."
        },
        {
            "question": "Discuss the concept of 'catastrophic forgetting' in the context of fine-tuning. How can one address this issue?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should define catastrophic forgetting and outline strategies like elastic weight consolidation, gradual unfreezing, and using rehearsal methods or joint training with some source data. The candidate might also mention continual learning techniques."
        },
        {
            "question": "How can transfer learning be applied in unsupervised or self-supervised learning settings, and what challenges might arise?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should explore how models pretrained with self-supervised objectives (e.g., contrastive learning) are transferred to downstream tasks and the importance of aligning the pretext task with the target task. Challenges like domain mismatch and subtle differences in data distributions should be mentioned."
        },
        {
            "question": "Explain the trade-offs between using a large, diverse pre-trained model versus a more task-specific pre-trained model in terms of fine-tuning performance and computational cost.",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should consider aspects like generalization capability, risk of overfitting, model size, inference speed, and the practicality of computational resources. A good answer will balance benefits and limitations of both approaches with relevant examples."
        },
        {
            "question": "When dealing with real-world, messy data, what are some strategies you would implement alongside transfer learning to ensure robust performance in a production environment?",
            "response_guideline": "The discussion should include data cleaning, robust data augmentation, outlier detection, and scaling strategies. The candidate should also discuss monitoring system performance post-deployment and handling edge cases, emphasizing a combination of algorithm and system-level solutions."
        },
        {
            "question": "How would you evaluate if a fine-tuned model has overfitted the new task's dataset? What metrics or validation strategies would you use?",
            "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer may cover the use of cross-validation, separate train/validate/test splits, early stopping based on validation loss, and deployment trials. The candidate should discuss metrics relevant to the task (accuracy, F1-score) and possibly stress robustness against overfitting through statistical significance testing."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are some common pitfalls when transferring models across different domains, and how can you identify and address these pitfalls early in the model adaptation process?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss pitfalls such as mismatched feature distributions, data bias, and differences in data modalities. They should suggest exploratory data analysis, domain-specific pre-processing, and possibly using domain adaptation techniques to align data distributions before fine-tuning."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do you determine the optimal learning rate for fine-tuning a pre-trained network, and what role do learning rate schedulers play in this process?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should mention techniques such as learning rate range tests, differential learning rates for different layers, and the use of schedulers like cosine annealing or step decay. A detailed explanation of why lower learning rates are usually beneficial for pre-trained layers would be expected."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a scenario where you need to scale your transfer learning model for deployment (e.g., on mobile devices or in a distributed system), what considerations would you take into account?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss trade-offs such as model compression, quantization, and pruning, as well as deployment frameworks and latency considerations. They should also consider system integration, monitoring, and the real-world trade-offs between model complexity and resource constraints."
