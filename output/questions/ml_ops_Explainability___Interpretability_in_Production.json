        {
            "question": "1. Can you explain the difference between explainability and interpretability in the context of machine learning models deployed in production?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer will clearly differentiate between the two concepts: interpretability as the inherent understandability of a model and explainability as techniques developed to provide insights into its predictions. The candidate should discuss trade-offs between model complexity and transparency, and reference examples or scenarios where one might be prioritized over the other."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. What are some common techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) for achieving model explainability, and how do they differ in terms of assumptions, output types, and limitations?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should cover the methodology behind popular tools like LIME and SHAP, describing how they approximate local explanations. A good response will detail the assumptions that each method makes about the model, practical differences in output (e.g., additive feature attributions), and any limitations, such as computational cost or potential unreliability in certain model domains."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Explain how you would incorporate interpretability and explainability considerations during the development and deployment stages of a production ML system. What metrics or tools would you monitor?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should articulate how to integrate explainability from design to production, discussing how interpretability assessments can inform feature selection and model architecture choices. The answer should include monitoring tools/mechanisms for detecting model drift, anomalous explanation patterns, and the challenge of maintaining consistency between training and real-world data. Mentioning version control for explanation outputs or qualitative evaluation metrics would be a plus."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. In a real-world production environment, data can be messy or evolving. How would you ensure that the explainability tools remain reliable and robust in the face of data quality issues and distributional shifts?",
            "response_guideline": "A solid response should include strategies for handling noisy or incomplete data and detail monitoring and recalibration routines for explainability methods as model input distributions or data quality change over time. It should highlight the importance of not over-interpreting spurious correlations produced by explanation methods when confronted with unexpected data patterns."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. What challenges do you foresee in scaling interpretability/ explainability solutions across a large, complex production system with diverse models, and how would you approach these challenges?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should explore scalability issues such as computational overhead, integration complexities across various model architectures, and maintaining a consistent interpretability framework. The answer may suggest the use of centralized explanation services, automation tools for maintaining explanation logs, and strategies to balance latency with the depth of explanation in real-time applications."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Explain a situation where a model's explanation may be misleading or misinterpreted. What pitfalls should practitioners be aware of to ensure that explanations are both valid and actionable?",
            "response_guideline": "A robust answer will identify scenarios where explanation techniques might provide over-simplified or incorrect insights (for example, in cases of correlated features or if the explanation method is misapplied). It should emphasize the need for domain expertise, proper validation of explanations, and caution against taking automated explanation outputs at face value without further analysis."
