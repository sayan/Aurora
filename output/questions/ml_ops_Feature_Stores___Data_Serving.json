        {
            "question": "1. What is a feature store and why is it essential in modern machine learning pipelines?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should define a feature store as a centralized repository for storing, managing, and serving features used in ML models. It should cover the importance of feature reuse, consistency between training and inference environments, and improved model reproducibility and efficiency in feature engineering."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. Explain the differences between offline and online (near real-time) feature serving systems. What are the trade-offs involved in each approach?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should describe offline feature stores being used for batch training and online feature stores for real-time inference. It should discuss trade-offs in latency, data freshness, throughput, consistency, and potential complexity in infrastructure, including challenges in synchronizing features between these systems."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. How would you design a feature store system capable of handling high-dimensional features with potentially messy data? What strategies would you employ for data cleaning and validation?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should incorporate the architectural design for scalability, including modular ingestion pipelines and storage mechanisms that support high-dimensional data. It should also cover methods for data cleaning, automated validation routines, error handling, data reconciliation, and mechanisms to handle missing or anomalous values using statistical and rule-based approaches."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. Discuss the challenges of schema evolution and versioning in a feature store. How would you manage changes in feature definitions over time while ensuring consistency between training and inference?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should explain the complexities associated with evolving feature schemas and the need for version control. A robust answer will include strategies such as backward compatibility, schema registries, automated testing for feature drift, documentation approaches, and methods to roll out changes safely without disrupting production systems."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. Stale features can be a significant issue in production systems. What potential pitfalls arise from stale or outdated feature values, and how would you mitigate them?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should discuss issues such as degraded model performance due to outdated information, inconsistency between training and serving, and potential business risks. It should also include practical mitigation strategies such as real-time updates, feature expiry policies, monitoring data freshness, and employing alerts for data drift or anomalies."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Imagine you are tasked with scaling a feature store to handle millions of feature lookup requests per second. What architectural strategies and technologies would you consider, and how would you address challenges such as latency and throughput?",
            "response_guideline": "The response should reflect a deep understanding of distributed systems. Candidates should mention the use of caching strategies, in-memory databases, partitioned storage, load balancing, potential use of CDNs, and latency reduction techniques. Consideration for eventual consistency vs. strong consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability should be a part of the discussion."
        },
        {
            "question": "7. In a real-world scenario, data sources can be messy and come with inconsistencies or missing values. How would you design the data ingestion pipeline for a feature store to robustly handle such challenges, and what monitoring practices would you implement post-deployment?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should describe an ingestion pipeline that includes pre-processing steps like data validation, error handling, transformation, and logging. It should propose strategies for handling missing or anomalous data, possibly using imputation or fallback defaults. Additionally, it should cover monitoring aspects such as alerting on data quality issues, regular audits of feature data, and establishing feedback loops with downstream models to ensure data integrity."
