{"questions": [{"question": "1. Can you explain the difference between filter, wrapper, and embedded methods of feature selection?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should define each method, explain the criteria for selection in each approach, and provide examples. The candidate should also discuss the pros and cons of each method."}, {"question": "2. What are some statistical tests you would use to evaluate the importance of features in a classification problem?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention tests such as Chi-squared, t-tests, ANOVA, or correlation coefficients. They should explain the context in which each test is used and what kind of information it provides."}, {"question": "3. Describe a scenario where a feature selection technique might lead to overfitting. How would you mitigate this risk?", "response_guideline": "A strong candidate should describe how using too many features can lead to overfitting. They should recommend strategies such as cross-validation, regularization techniques (like L1/Lasso), or using simpler models."}, {"question": "4. How would you approach feature selection when dealing with a high-dimensional dataset?", "response_guideline": "The answer should cover methods specifically designed for high-dimensionality, like PCA, LDA, or specific algorithms that stress efficiency. Look for a discussion about the trade-off between information loss and performance."}, {"question": "5. Can you explain the concept of recursive feature elimination and how it works?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should detail how recursive feature elimination systematically removes the least important features based on the model\u2019s performance, including the iterative process and potential computational considerations."}, {"question": "6. What methods would you use to evaluate the effectiveness of your feature selection?", "response_guideline": "Good responses should include metrics such as model accuracy, F1 score, ROC-AUC, or even techniques like k-fold cross-validation. Candidates should mention how these metrics might vary before and after feature selection."}, {"question": "7. Discuss the role of domain knowledge in feature selection. Can you provide an example where it significantly impacted the results?", "response_guideline": "The candidate should highlight how domain knowledge can help identify relevant features and their interactions. An example showcasing a situation where domain knowledge led to better model performance is critical."}, {"question": "8. What are the potential pitfalls of using automated feature selection methods in practice?", "response_guideline": "Look for discussion on issues like biased feature selection due to correlation, the lack of interpretability of some methods, or the risk of including noise as significant features."}, {"question": "9. How do you handle missing data when performing feature selection?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention techniques like imputation, removal of features with excessive missing values, or filtering based on the percentage of missing data prior to feature selection."}, {"question": "10. Explain how you would deploy a model after selecting features. What considerations must be made regarding feature selection in the deployment phase?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss the importance of maintaining a consistent feature set in the deployment environment, version control of the model, and the need for retraining the model as new data comes in."}, {"question": "11. In a binary classification problem, how does the selection of features impact the interpretability of the model?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should discuss the trade-off between the number of features and interpretability. Candidates should suggest methods to assess model interpretability, such as using SHAP values or LIME."}, {"question": "12. Can you elaborate on the impact of multicollinearity in feature selection and how to address it?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should define multicollinearity, explain its impact on the model\u2019s performance, and suggest how to detect it (e.g., Variance Inflation Factor) and solutions, such as removing or combining correlated features."}, {"question": "13. Describe a scenario in which you used feature selection in a real-world project. What technique did you use, what challenges did you face, and what was the outcome?", "response_guideline": "Look for a detailed example demonstrating the candidate's hands-on experience. They should discuss the context, rationale for technique choice, and the final impact of feature selection on model performance."}, {"question": "14. What is the effect of feature scaling on feature selection, and how should you implement it?", "response_guideline": "A solid response should explain why scaling is important (e.g., algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude) and the methods available (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) to implement scaling responsibly."}, {"question": "15. How would you go about selecting features for a time series classification task?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention strategies like lag features, rolling statistics, and time-based aggregations. They should also discuss how to avoid data leakage in this context."}]}
