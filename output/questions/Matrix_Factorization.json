{"questions": [{"question": "Can you explain what matrix factorization is and provide examples of its applications in recommendation systems?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should define matrix factorization, describe the concept of decomposing a matrix into products of matrices, and provide examples like collaborative filtering in recommendation systems (e.g., MovieLens or Amazon recommendations). Though basic, they should also touch upon the importance of latent factors."}, {"question": "What are the mathematical formulations for matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)?", "response_guideline": "Applicants should cover the mathematical representation of SVD, explaining how it decomposes a matrix into three other matrices (U, \u03a3, V) and should detail the constraints of NMF, including how it ensures all factors are non-negative, along with its objective function."}, {"question": "Explain how to choose the appropriate number of latent factors in a matrix factorization model. What metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of the model?", "response_guideline": "Expected answers should discuss techniques like cross-validation, Bayesian optimization, and metrics such as RMSE or MAE to evaluate model performance. They should recognize overfitting risks and trade-offs affecting model accuracy and complexity."}, {"question": "What are some common regularization techniques used in matrix factorization, and why are they important?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention techniques such as L2 regularization (Ridge) or L1 regularization (Lasso), and explain how these help prevent overfitting and improve generalization on unseen data."}, {"question": "How would you handle missing data in a user-item interaction matrix when applying matrix factorization algorithms?", "response_guideline": "Look for thoughtful approaches such as using imputation methods (mean, k-NN, etc.), or leveraging models that can handle missing values inherently (e.g., using alternating least squares). Candidates should emphasize the importance of avoiding biases introduced by imputation."}, {"question": "Discuss the challenges associated with scalability in matrix factorization. How might one address these issues?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should highlight challenges like computational cost and memory usage with large datasets. They might suggest techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch training, or parallel computing strategies to manage scalability successfully."}, {"question": "What is the difference between implicit and explicit feedback in matrix factorization-based models? How would this affect your approach to designing the model?", "response_guideline": "A good answer should differentiate between explicit ratings (like star ratings) and implicit feedback (like clicks or views), discussing the impact these have on factorization approaches, like using models such as ALS for implicit feedback."}, {"question": "How would you evaluate a collaborative filtering model based on matrix factorization? What would be your process for model validation?", "response_guideline": "Look for an answer that details steps such as splitting data into training/testing sets, using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, and comparing performance against baseline models to demonstrate understanding of model validation."}, {"question": "In real-world applications, how do you address the cold start problem in user-item recommendation systems using matrix factorization?", "response_guideline": "Candidates should discuss strategies like leveraging content-based features, using hybrid models, or incorporating demographic information to help mitigate cold start issues."}, {"question": "Can you describe how gradient descent is utilized in the context of matrix factorization, and what potential issues one might encounter?", "response_guideline": "A strong response should cover how gradient descent updates feature vectors iteratively, the potential pitfalls of convergence, local minima, and the importance of learning rates. They might also discuss optimization strategies like Adam or RMSprop."}, {"question": "What potential biases can emerge from using matrix factorization techniques in practice, and how would you identify and mitigate them?", "response_guideline": "Look for candidates to identify biases such as popularity bias or echo chambers, discussing methods to audit input data, employ fairness metrics, or incorporate diversity-enhancing strategies in recommendation systems."}, {"question": "Describe an example of a situation where matrix factorization would be ineffective or less suitable as a solution. What alternative methods would you suggest?", "response_guideline": "Expect candidates to provide scenarios like sparse data, highly dynamic environments, or cases requiring rich contextual information, suggesting alternatives like neural collaborative filtering or content-based filtering methods."}, {"question": "How do you interpret and visualize the results from a matrix factorization model? What insights can be derived from the latent factors?", "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should cover techniques for visualizing latent factors (e.g., t-SNE plots) and interpreting dimensions of features, along with discussing how these can be used for actionable insights in product recommendation."}, {"question": "Have you ever applied matrix factorization in a project? Describe any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. What was the impact?", "response_guideline": "Look for real-world experience sharing. Candidates should discuss specific challenges encountered, such as data quality issues or implementation hurdles, and detail problem-solving techniques, along with clear outcomes and impacts on the project."}]}
