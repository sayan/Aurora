        {
            "question": "1. What is the objective function minimized by K-Means clustering, and how is it computed?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should mention that K-Means minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids. The response should include the mathematical formulation of the objective function and discuss how the iterative steps of assignment and update work to reduce this cost."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. Can you walk me through the basic iterative steps of the K-Means algorithm and discuss its convergence properties?",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should describe the two primary steps: the assignment step (assigning points to the closest centroid) and the update step (recomputing centroids as the mean of the assigned points). They should mention that the algorithm converges when assignments no longer change or upon meeting another stopping condition, but also note that convergence is typically to a local optimum rather than a global optimum."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. How do initial centroid selections affect the performance of K-Means, and what is the purpose of techniques like K-Means++?",
            "response_guideline": "A correct answer should discuss sensitivity to initialization, potential for convergence to poor local minima, and emphasize that K-Means++ aims to choose initial seeds that are spread out to promote better convergence behavior and often better clustering outcomes."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. Discuss how K-Means clustering performs when the data clusters are non-spherical or vary significantly in size and density. What are the underlying assumptions of K-Means?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for an explanation that highlights K-Means assumes spherical and equally sized clusters, and may perform poorly when clusters are elongated, have unequal sizes, or exhibit different densities. The candidate should discuss the limitation of using Euclidean distances in such cases."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. How would you handle the case where, during the iterative process, one or more clusters end up empty?",
            "response_guideline": "An ideal answer should describe methods such as reinitializing the centroid of an empty cluster (possibly to a random data point or far from existing centroids) or adapting the algorithm to ensure that every centroid gets reassigned. It\u2019s important to emphasize the practical handling of this edge-case to avoid algorithm stalling."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Explain different methods you can use to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) in K-Means.",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should discuss approaches like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, Gap Statistic, and potentially other information criteria methods. The candidate should compare their strengths and weaknesses and highlight practical considerations when using these methods."
        },
        {
            "question": "7. How can outliers affect the performance of K-Means clustering? What strategies would you implement to mitigate their impact?",
            "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should highlight that outliers can unduly influence centroid calculations, leading to skewed clusters. Mitigation strategies may include preprocessing steps such as outlier detection and removal, using robust scaling techniques, or even shifting to alternative clustering methods that are less sensitive to outliers."
        },
        {
            "question": "8. Can K-Means be directly applied to categorical data? If not, what modifications or alternative clustering algorithms could you consider?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for the mention that K-Means is inherently designed for continuous numerical data because of its reliance on means and Euclidean distances. The candidate should suggest alternatives such as K-Modes for categorical data, or discuss encoding techniques that could enable a variation of K-Means, along with noting potential pitfalls of such transformations."
        },
        {
            "question": "9. Discuss scalability challenges associated with K-Means when dealing with large-scale datasets and potential strategies for acceleration.",
            "response_guideline": "Candidates should mention the computational costs involved in distance calculations for large datasets and propose solutions such as mini-batch K-Means, approximate nearest neighbor methods, or leveraging distributed computing frameworks. Additional points might include data sampling or dimensionality reduction techniques."
        },
        {
            "question": "10. How does feature scaling affect the results of K-Means clustering, and what pre-processing steps would you recommend before applying the algorithm?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should highlight that K-Means is sensitive to the scale of the features due to its use of Euclidean distances. Preferred steps include normalization or standardization of the data, and possibly dimensionality reduction if there are correlated features. The candidate should provide reasoning on these methods."
        },
        {
            "question": "11. In real-world scenarios, data can be messy and may include missing values or noisy entries. How would you adapt or preprocess such data for effective K-Means clustering?",
            "response_guideline": "A solid response should include methods for handling missing values (like imputation), detecting and mitigating noise, and possibly robust scaling. They may also suggest running multiple initializations or employing preclustering techniques to improve robustness, emphasizing practical experience with imperfect datasets."
        },
        {
            "question": "12. Advanced: Can you compare the optimization landscape of the K-Means clustering problem with that of other clustering methods? What makes K-Means particularly susceptible to poor local minima, and what strategies can help escape these pitfalls?",
            "response_guideline": "This answer should include discussion of non-convex objective functions in K-Means that often lead to local minima. A strong candidate might compare it to EM in Gaussian Mixture Models, mentioning initialization sensitivity and iterative minimization. They should discuss strategies such as multiple runs, sophisticated initialization (like K-Means++), and even alternative formulations or heuristics to escape local minima."
        },
        {
            "question": "13. How would you assess and validate the quality of the clusters produced by K-Means in a given dataset?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should talk about internal validation metrics (such as silhouette coefficient, Davies-Bouldin index, and Calinski-Harabasz index) as well as external validation if labels are available. Discussion should also include qualitative evaluation methods and considerations regarding the stability and interpretability of the clusters."
