            "question": "1. Can you explain the basic intuition behind gradient descent and how it is used to minimize a cost function in machine learning models?",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should describe the notion of using the gradient to iteratively update parameters in the opposite direction of the slope, mention the significance of the learning rate, and ideally reference common pitfalls like overshooting minima and getting stuck in local optima."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. How does the choice of learning rate affect the convergence of gradient descent? How would you diagnose and address issues arising from an improperly tuned learning rate?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss the effects of a too-large learning rate (divergence or oscillation) versus a too-small learning rate (slow convergence), and may mention techniques for tuning such as learning rate schedules, adaptive methods like AdaGrad or RMSProp, and plotting the loss curve to diagnose issues."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Describe the differences between batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent. In what scenarios might one variant be preferred over the others?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong response should cover the trade-offs among the three variants: full-batch for stable updates in small datasets, stochastic for faster updates with noisy, but potentially less stable, gradient estimates, and mini-batch as a balance. The candidate should also consider memory constraints, convergence speed, and computational efficiency."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. Gradient descent can encounter difficulty in non-convex optimization problems. How do methods that incorporate momentum, or adaptive learning rates, help overcome the challenges posed by non-convex landscapes?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should cover how momentum helps in dampening oscillations and accelerating convergence along shallow directions, and how adaptive methods adjust the learning rate based on historical gradients to cope with varied curvature. Discussion might include trade-offs and potential pitfalls, such as overemphasis on rapid convergence in certain directions that might ignore some local minima."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. In a scenario where you are dealing with messy, real-world data and a large-scale model, what challenges could arise when using gradient descent? How would you address issues related to scalability, data noise, and potential deployment in production?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention challenges such as noisy gradients due to messy data, saddle points, the computational cost of processing large datasets, and issues with feature scaling or normalization. Answers should include potential solutions like robust preprocessing, using mini-batch gradient descent, employing distributed computing frameworks, and careful monitoring of convergence during deployment."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. Can you outline the theoretical convergence guarantees for gradient descent under strong convexity and Lipschitz continuity assumptions? What are the key lemmas or theorems used in establishing these results?",
            "response_guideline": "A comprehensive answer should mention that under strong convexity and Lipschitz continuity, gradient descent guarantees convergence at a linear rate. The candidate should reference relevant results such as convergence proofs that use properties of smooth functions, descent lemmas, and Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. They may also compare these theoretical guarantees to the behavior of gradient descent in non-ideal (non-convex) settings."
