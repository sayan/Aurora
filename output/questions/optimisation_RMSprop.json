            "question": "Can you explain the RMSprop optimization algorithm, including its key update equations, and contrast how it differs from AdaGrad?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should outline the RMSprop update rule: maintaining an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, computing the adaptive learning rate by dividing by the square root of this average plus a small constant (epsilon) for numerical stability. The candidate should compare this with AdaGrad, highlighting how AdaGrad accumulates squared gradients leading to aggressive learning rate decay, while RMSprop mitigates this with a decay factor."
        },
        {
            "question": "Discuss the role of the hyperparameters in RMSprop, specifically the decay rate (often denoted as beta or rho) and the epsilon term. How do these parameters affect convergence and stability of training?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should mention that the decay rate controls how much history of past gradients is considered when calculating the running average, affecting the smoothing of gradient estimates. The epsilon term prevents division by zero and can influence numerical stability. A high decay rate might slow adaptation to recent changes, whereas too low a value might lead to noisy updates. The candidate should explore tuning difficulties and potential trade-offs."
        },
        {
            "question": "Derive the mathematical update equation for RMSprop. Explain how the use of an exponentially weighted moving average of squared gradients modifies the learning rate per parameter.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should derive the equation emphasizing that for each parameter, the new squared gradient moving average is computed as: g_t^2 = decay_factor * g_{t-1}^2 + (1 - decay_factor) * (gradient)^2, and the parameter update involves dividing the current gradient by the square root of this average plus epsilon. The explanation should detail how this adaptive scaling helps mitigate issues such as exploding gradients and stabilizes training."
        },
        {
            "question": "RMSprop is often applied in deep learning contexts. Can you describe a scenario with noisy or sparse data where RMSprop might encounter difficulties? What strategies would you propose to address these pitfalls?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should identify that in scenarios with very noisy gradients or sparse data, the moving average might not capture the true gradient signal effectively. The candidate might suggest adjustments such as tuning the decay rate, combining RMSprop with momentum, or employing other adaptive methods like Adam. Discussion of optional modifications or alternative regularization strategies will indicate advanced understanding."
        },
        {
            "question": "Describe how you would troubleshoot and diagnose training performance issues when using RMSprop. Which key metrics or behaviors would signal that the optimizer's hyperparameters might need re-tuning?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should mention monitoring training loss as well as the norms of the gradients, potential oscillations, or flat regions in the loss landscape. They might discuss examining the effect of different decay rates and epsilon values. A comprehensive answer would include steps like visualizing the learning curves, checking for diverging parameter updates, or using learning rate schedulers to fine-tune performance in presence of noisy gradients."
        },
        {
            "question": "In a practical implementation, how would you adapt RMSprop to a mini-batch gradient descent scenario, and what computational considerations (e.g., memory or processing overhead) might be important when scaling to very large neural networks?",
            "response_guideline": "The answer should cover that RMSprop inherently applies to mini-batch settings by computing gradients across batches and updating the moving averages accordingly. Discussion should include the per-parameter memory requirement for storing moving averages and the importance of vectorized operations for efficiency. Consideration of issues like parallelization, GPU utilization, and potential bottlenecks in memory access would show practical mastery."
        },
        {
            "question": "Modern optimizers like Adam extend ideas from RMSprop. How would you argue for or against using RMSprop over Adam in a specific deep learning task? What are the scenarios where RMSprop might still be preferable?",
            "response_guideline": "A considered answer should acknowledge that Adam combines RMSprop with momentum for potentially faster convergence and might work better in many settings. However, the candidate should provide scenarios where RMSprop\u2019s simplicity can be advantageous, such as in cases with memory constraints or when the problem domain does not require the additional complexity of momentum. The discussion should cover empirical evidence, risk of overfitting from overly aggressive adaptive methods, and computational trade-offs."
