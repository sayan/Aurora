        {
            "question": "1. Explain the fundamental differences between A/B testing and canary deployments. In what scenarios would you prefer one over the other?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should describe A/B testing as a controlled experiment to compare two or more variants using randomized trials and statistical significance, while emphasizing canary deployments as a gradual rollout technique typically used for monitoring system behavior and limiting exposure to new changes. They should discuss the context of application (e.g., feature performance evaluation vs. production safety) and mention factors like risk, user segmentation, and infrastructure differences."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. What statistical considerations are important when designing an A/B test, and how do you ensure the validity of the results?",
            "response_guideline": "A strong answer should cover aspects such as sample size determination, randomization, control of confounding variables, hypothesis formulation (null and alternative), significance levels, and multiple testing corrections. The candidate should also mention techniques like confidence intervals, p-values, and the importance of once-off data splits or stratified sampling. They might also discuss pitfalls like p-hacking and ensuring robustness to variations in user behavior."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. Describe a scenario where data might be messy or incomplete during an A/B test, and explain how you would address these issues to ensure reliable results.",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should discuss potential issues such as missing data, tracking inconsistencies, and biases in data collection. They should propose solutions like data imputation, robust pre-test validation, data-cleaning pipelines, using robust statistical techniques, and sensitivity analysis. It\u2019s important to mention strategies for handling outliers and ensuring integrity through consistency checks and validation tests."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. When managing canary deployments, how do you monitor the performance and safety of the newly released variant? What metrics would you track, and what thresholds might trigger a rollback?",
            "response_guideline": "Look for a discussion on operational metrics such as error rates, response times, resource utilization, and throughput; business metrics like user engagement or conversion; and system-specific KPIs. The candidate should explain how to set alerting thresholds, use dashboards for real-time monitoring, and ideally mention automated rollback mechanisms. They should also acknowledge the need for understanding historical baselines and variability to set meaningful thresholds."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. Discuss the trade-offs involved in scaling A/B tests and canary deployments in a large, high-traffic environment. What architectural considerations would you factor in?",
            "response_guideline": "The candidate should include points on scalability challenges such as load balancing, distributed tracking, data aggregation, and latency. They should mention potential issues with traffic segmentation, sample size bias, network partitions, and fault-tolerance. A principal-level answer would elaborate on techniques like canary analysis, decentralized logging, real-time analytics, and strategies to minimize disruption during rollouts."
        },
        {
            "question": "6. How would you design an end-to-end experiment framework that combines A/B testing and canary deployments for iterative feature releases? Describe your approach to integrating both techniques.",
            "response_guideline": "This answer should outline a comprehensive workflow that starts with canary deployments to mitigate risk, followed by expanded A/B testing among a broader audience. The candidate should mention components including deployment automation, logging and monitoring, statistical evaluation, feedback loops, and iterative improvement. They should also address challenges like data consistency, synchronization between testing layers, and ensuring that the rollout process is both safe and effective."
