            "question": "1. Could you briefly explain the concept of momentum as used in optimization algorithms such as SGD with momentum? Please discuss the role of the momentum coefficient and its impact on gradient descent updates.",
            "response_guideline": "A good answer should cover the idea that momentum is used to accelerate gradient descent by accumulating past gradients, thereby smoothing updates. The candidate should explain that the momentum coefficient (often denoted as \u03b3 or \u03b2) controls the extent to which previous gradients contribute to the current update, helping to overcome issues like oscillations in steep, narrow ravines."
        },
        {
            "question": "2. Derive the update rule for a momentum-based gradient descent algorithm mathematically. How does this update rule influence the direction and magnitude of parameter updates during training?",
            "response_guideline": "The response should include a clear mathematical derivation of the update rule, typically showing that v_t = \u03b3 * v_(t-1) + \u03b7 * \u2207L(\u03b8_t) and \u03b8_(t+1) = \u03b8_t - v_t. The candidate should describe how the momentum term accumulates previous gradients and how this influences convergence by accelerating in consistent directions while damping oscillatory movements, thereby smoothing the trajectory towards a local minimum."
        },
        {
            "question": "3. What are some potential pitfalls when implementing momentum-based optimization? Discuss how the choice of the momentum parameter and learning rate might lead to issues such as overshooting or unstable convergence, including any corner cases in certain loss landscapes.",
            "response_guideline": "A robust answer should mention that choosing an excessively high momentum value may lead to overshooting or instability, particularly in non-convex or rapidly changing loss landscapes. The candidate should discuss the interplay between the momentum parameter and learning rate, cautioning that improper tuning may affect convergence. Specific corner cases, such as when gradients change direction abruptly or in flat regions, should be highlighted along with strategies to mitigate these issues."
        },
        {
            "question": "4. In scenarios with noisy or sparse gradients, such as those encountered in real-world data, how might you modify momentum-based methods or combine them with other techniques to improve optimization?",
            "response_guideline": "An excellent answer should reference adaptations like Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) as a variant of momentum, or even a discussion on combining momentum with adaptive learning rate methods such as Adam or RMSProp when dealing with noisy and sparse gradients. The candidate should explain how these modifications can help reduce variance, improve stability, or effectively manage the intermittency of updates in sparse contexts."
        },
        {
            "question": "5. Discuss the challenges and practical considerations of deploying momentum-based optimization in large-scale distributed training environments. How does the propagation of momentum affect convergence across multiple workers, and what strategies would you recommend to ensure robust performance?",
            "response_guideline": "The response should include discussions on issues such as synchronization of momentum updates across distributed workers, potential staleness of gradients, and the complexity of aggregating momentum terms. A strong answer would suggest solutions like synchronized updates, adaptive adjustments to momentum coefficients in distributed settings, and possibly the use of decoupled or federated optimization approaches to preserve convergence properties without sacrificing scalability."
